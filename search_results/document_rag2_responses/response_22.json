States. You state that you do not intend to ship these notes internationally and that the notes are no longer valid currency.  The Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (ITSR), generally prohibit the importation into the United States of any goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.201. Additionally, the ITSR generally prohibit U.S. persons, wherever located, from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.206(a)(1). This prohibition includes but is not limited to purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing. ITSR, § 560.206(b). The ITSR define the term U.S. person to mean any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. ITSR, § 560.314. Finally, section 560.211(a) of the ITSR provides that all property and interests in property of the Government of Iran that are or come within the United States, or that are or come within the possession or control of any U.S. person, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.  The ITSR, however, do not prohibit the importation from or exportation to any country of information and informational materials, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission. 31 C.F.R. §§ 560.210(c), 560.315. This exemption does not exempt from regulation or authorize transactions related to information or informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services. In addition, please note that section 560.518 of the ITSR authorizes, inter alia, all domestic transactions with respect to Iranian- origin goods located in the United States other than goods blocked pursuant to section 560.211. 31 C.F.R. § 560.518(a).  To the extent the Iranian-origin banknotes that are not valid currency qualify as informational materials, their importation from and exportation to any country would be exempt from the prohibitions of the ITSR. Wholly domestic transactions[1] with respect to such Iranian-origin banknotes in the United States that are not valid currency would fall outside the informational materials exemption and could be subject to the prohibition set forth in section 560.206(a)(1) of the ITSR, unless licensed by OFAC. However, transactions with respect to such banknotes located in the United States that meet the requirements of section 560.518 of the ITSR are authorized. By contrast, if the transactions relate to Iranian-origin banknotes that are valid currency or are wholly domestic transactions in countries other than the United States, they would be prohibited unless specifically licensed by OFAC.  To the extent that your proposed sale of Iranian-origin banknotes is an exempt export of informational materials or complies with the authorization in section 560.518 of the ITSR, it would be allowed, and no further authorization from OFAC would be required. However, any potential sales of Iranian-origin banknotes that fall outside of the exemption at section 560.210(c) or the authorization at 560.518 would be prohibited unless specifically licensed by OFAC.  If you have any additional questions, you may refer to the OFAC website atywww.treasury.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.  Sincerely,   [June 19, 2020]   Anna Chenoweth Chief, Licensing Division Office of Foreign Assets Control   [1] The term \"wholly domestic transaction\" refers to a transaction with respect to an item within a single country that is not incident to the exportation to or importation from any country of the item.\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1)  BACKGROUND  This important guidance letter, which should be read alongside the coin-related Case No. MUL-2013-305202-1 contains a number of notable determinations, i.e. determinations concerning the meaning of \"informational materials,\" the scope of the GL at 560.518 of the ITSR, and the meaning of \"interest\" as it relates to the blocking prohibition.   The applicant is a U.S. person seeking authorization to \"Iranian-origin collectible banknotes in the United. States. [The applicant] state[s] that [it did] not intend to ship these notes internationally and that the notes are no longer valid currency,\" but OFAC addresses (sometimes implicitly) four different scenarios in its determination. They are as follows:  •  The banknotes are shipped abroad and are valid currency (prohibited) •  The banknotes are shipped abroad and they are not valid currency (exempt) •  The banknotes are not shipped abroad and they are valid currency (authorized) •  The banknotes are not shipped abroad and they are not valid currency (authorized)  2)  \"INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS\" IN THE DEMONETIZED \"BANKNOTES\" CONTEXT  OFAC appears to be of the view that, as it relates to printed paper, the \"informational materials\" determination can turn on whether such paper has some form of inherent value or is otherwise a \"negotiable instrument\". See e.g. Case No. NK-93087 (unused stamps from a foreign country were not exempt as informational materials). What about a used postage stamp?  Here, as it relates to \"Iranian-origin\" Banknotes, OFAC concludes that \"[t]o the extent the Iranian-origin banknotes that are not valid currency qualify as informational materials, their importation from and exportation to any country would be exempt from the prohibitions of the ITSR\",  and that \"no further authorization from OFAC would be required\". \"By contrast, if the transactions relate to Iranian-origin banknotes that are valid currency,\" then transactions involving such banknotes are outside the scope of the informational materials exemption.  As of the 4-19-24 date of this writing, no other OFAC determination in the Research System so neatly illustrates the way in which the \"informational materials\" operates as it relates to \"negotiable instruments\" and similar items. Here, the same exact piece of paper can go from being outside the scope of \"information and informational materials\" (560.315) to inside the scope of the exemption by virtue of it being demonetized. This determination has implications for items other than banknotes, where the logic should extend to the difference between used and unused postage stamps, valid and voided checks, valid and canceled stock certificates.   Note that the determination above applies only with respect to banknotes, and not coins, which appear to fall outside the scope of informational materials even if they are out of circulation. See Case No. MUL-2013-305202-1.  3)  BANKNOTES AS \"IRANIAN-ORIGIN GOODS\"  OFAC determines that \"sales of Iranian-origin banknotes that fall outside of the exemption at section 560.210(c) or the authorization at 560.518 would be prohibited unless specifically licensed by OFAC\". Because this is the case even if the sale does not involve any sanctioned person, and because OFAC uses the term \"Iranian-origin banknotes,\" it is evident that OFAC regards banknotes to constitute \"goods\" of Iranian-origin for purposes of 560.306 of the ITSR, such that dealings therein by U.S. persons are generally prohibited by 560.206 of the ITSR (this is consistent with Case No. MUL-2013-305202-1 in the coins context). This stands in contrast to \"funds\" in the abstract.    4)  \"INTEREST\" AS IT RELATES TO CURRENCY (VALID AND NON-VALID)  Consistent with OFAC determination in the Iranian-origin coins context, OFAC determines that section 560.518 of the ITSR (authorizing \"all domestic transactions with respect to Iranian- origin goods located in the United States other than goods blocked pursuant to section 560.211\"), applies to the applicants’ dealing in the banknotes if they are \"wholly domestic transactions\" in the United States. Implicit in this determination is that, even if the banknotes were still valid currency such that their export were not exempt from regulation, dealings in the banknotes can qualify for 560.518 and therefore they are not \"goods blocked pursuant to section 560.211\". This would mean that the Government of Iran would not necessarily have an \"interest\" in all valid currency that it has issued. Accord Case No. MUL-2013-305202-1 concerning coins.   5)  560.518 DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS; THE \"WHOLLY DOMESTIC TRANSACTION\" STANDARD RELEVANT TO THE INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS EXEMPTION AND 560.518  As noted above, section 560.518 of the ITSR authorizes \"all domestic transactions with respect to Iranian- origin goods located in the United States other than goods blocked pursuant to section 560.211\". OFAC says that \"if the transactions relate to Iranian-origin banknotes that are valid currency or are wholly domestic transactions in countries other than the United States, they would be prohibited unless specifically licensed by OFAC,\" and \"[t]he term ‘wholly domestic transaction’  refers to a transaction with respect to an item within a single country that is not incident to the exportation to or importation from any country of the item.\"  This means that, with respect to demonetized currency that would otherwise qualify for the informational materials exemption, the informational materials exemption does not apply where the U.S. person-implicating transaction at issue is (i) outside of the United States (such that 560.518 does not apply), and (ii) \"with respect to [the banknotes] within a single [non-U.S.] country that is not incident to the exportation to or importation from any country of the [banknotes]\".   While this guidance letter is the only articulation of the \"wholly domestic transaction\" standard that appears in the Research System as of this writing, it makes sense given that the informational materials exemption covers \"the importation from any country and the exportation to any country of information or informational materials\" (as well as, in practice, transactions \"incident to the exportation to or importation from any country of\" such materials. (See generally Examples of Transactions Exempt as Incident to Underlying Informational Materials Transactions).  With respect to the practical application of the \"wholly domestic transaction\" standard in practice, there may be few transactions that qualify. Take the example of an individual ordinarily resident in Iran that is located in the U.S., and a U.S. person provides that individual with a book. While the provision of the book occurs entirely within the U.S., there is no question that this would qualify for the informational materials exemption. Compare e.g. Case No. IA-9573 (\"exchange of information and informational materials\" between U.S. persons and Iranians at a U.S. trade show can be exempt) and 560.418 (the \"release of technology or software in the United States\" is not prohibited where \"that technology or software meets the definition of information and informational materials in § 560.315\"). In these cases, and consistent with OFAC’s interpretation of the prohibition on exports to Iran (560.204) as covering exports to persons ordinarily resident in Iran wherever located, the transaction would not be \"wholly domestic\" even where there is no shipment of the item outside of the United States. The one class of transactions that would presumably comfortably fit into the \"wholly domestic transaction\" category is one in which, e.g., an Iranian located in Iran sells a book to another Iranian located in Iran and want to involve a U.S. person in the underlying transaction.  \n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

If so, both the payment and the dealing in the Iranian origin goods are separate violations of 560.206, even if there was nothing within the scope of 560.201. The payment to the bank would be dealing in a service controlled by the GOI, and the import of the goods an import of goods of Iranian origin.   2) Compare Civil Enforcement Information - ZAG IP, LLC (2019) (the goods) and Civil Enforcement Information - LI-COR, Inc (2008) (the payment).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

The Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R.

ITSR, § 560.204. Additionally, the ITSR generally prohibit U.S. persons, wherever located, from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; or goods, technology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.206(a). This prohibition includes but is not limited to purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing. ITSR, § 560.206(b). The ITSR define the term U.S. person to mean any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. ITSR, § 560.314.  Section 560.524(b) of the ITSR, however, includes a provision for the importation of general household goods by a U.S. person without specific license, provided that the goods have actually been used by the importing individual or family members of the importing individual, and that the goods will be used in the United States by the same individuals. If the importation of your Iranian-origin carpets falls within the general license, then no further authorization from OFAC is required.

You write that after an upcoming coming visit with your family in Iran, you wish to bring a carpet from your former home in Iran back with you to the United States, which you bought twenty years ago. Accordingly, you request authorization from OFAC to import these goods to the United States.  The Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R.

The ITR also generally prohibit the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply of any goods, technology, or services, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.204. Additionally, the ITSR generally prohibit U.S. persons, wherever located, from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; or goods, technology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.206(a). This prohibition includes but is not limited to purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing. ITSR, § 560.206(b). The ITSR define the term U.S. person to mean any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. ITSR, § 560.314.  However, the ITSR authorize the importation by persons arriving in the United States of Iranian origin household and personal effects, including baggage and articles for family use. ITSR, § 560.524(b). To qualify for this authorization, articles must have been actually used abroad by the person arriving in the United States or by other family members arriving from the same foreign household, must not be intended for any other person or for sale, and must not be otherwise prohibited from importation. ITSR, § 560.524(b).  Based on the information provided in your letter, the proposed importation of your carpet used in your former home in Iran to the United States appears to qualify for the general authorization provided by section 560.524 of the ITSR. Therefore, the importation referenced may proceed without further authorization from OFAC.

No. IA-361423  [MAR 13 2008]  Susan Hamrock Mann   Director, Afghanistan and Iraq Investment and Reconstruction Task Force  International Trade Administration  U.S. Department of Commerce  1400 Constitution Ave. NW, Room 3421  Washington, DC 20230   Dear Ms. Mann:   Thank you for your letter to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") requesting  interpretive guidance on U.S. sanctions policy toward Iran. In your letter, you seek guidance on whether Afghan-origin goods that are transshipped through Iran are subject to the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the \"ITR\").   Under the ITR, goods that are transshipped through Iran enter into Iranian commerce and become goods of Iranian-origin. ITR, § 560.306. As such, those goods are prohibited from importation into the United States, and U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions or dealings in or related to those goods. ITR, §§ 560.201, 560.206. In addition, U.S. persons, wherever located, are prohibited from exporting goods to Iran, regardless of the origin of those goods. ITR, § 560.204.   The ITR contain an authorization for the importation into the United States of certain foodstuffs and carpets of Iranian-origin, as well as for transactions or dealings by U.S. persons in those goods, provided that such activities do not involve otherwise prohibited transactions that are not considered ordinarily incident to that authorization. ITR, § 560.534. Therefore, Afghan-origin foodstuffs and carpets that have entered Iranian commerce and that otherwise meet the conditions set forth in ITR § 560.534 may be imported into the United States at the present time, and U.S. persons may engage in transactions ordinarily incident to that importation and necessary to give effect thereto. For example, U.S. persons, wherever located, may engage in loading such Afghan goods at an Iranian port for shipment to the United States. U.S. persons also may purchase such Afghan goods in markets outside of Iran, such as markets in the United Arab Emirates, for importation into the United States.   However, U.S. persons, wherever located, are prohibited from engaging in or facilitating the transshipment of any goods through Iran or entering into a contract for the exportation of goods to Iran, including Afghan-origin foodstuffs and carpets that are ultimately destined for importation into the United States. The provision of any transportation services to or from Iran, other than, in this case, loading the licensed cargo for shipment to the United States, is not authorized as ordinarily incident to the importation into the United States; nor is a transaction by an unlicensed Iranian governmental entity so authorized. OFAC will consider applications for specific licenses for U.S. persons to engage in such otherwise prohibited transactions necessary to transship via Iran for importation into the United States Afghan-origin foodstuffs and carpets that otherwise meet the requirements of the general license set forth in ITR § 560.534. Prior to submitting a specific license application or to engaging in any transactions pursuant to ITR § 560.534, however, U.S. persons should check OFAC's Web site and the Federal Register for any relevant changes to the ITR.  Sincerely,   Adam J. Szubin Director Office of Foreign Assets Control\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) The regulations underlying this guidance have changed since the guidance letter was sent, but the principles underlying it should continue to apply nonetheless. At the time of the request and response, Iranian foodstuffs were generally licensed for import into the U.S. (Provision interpreted available at: https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2008-title31-vol3/xml/CFR-2008-title31-vol3-part560.xml#seqnum).   Then, as now, 560.306(a)(2) provided that \"[g]oods that have entered into Iranian commerce\" are considered to be of \"Iranian origin\" for the purposes of the ITR/ITSR, and accordingly cannot be dealt in (560.206) or imported into the U.S. (560.201) without authorization or unless exempt. A good being transshipped overland through Iran is considered to enter into Iranian commerce.   Here, OFAC says that if item X is truly of Iranian origin (i.e. not of \"Iranian origin\" as a legal fiction) and may be imported into the U.S. under general license, then an item that is truly of foreign origin that becomes Iranian origin \"by operation of law\" via entro into Iranian commerce (560.306(a)(2)) may also be imported into the U.S., because it takes on \"Iranian origin\" by virtue of the transshipment, and, therefore, is also generally licensed for import.  3) OFAC notes that \"loading such Afghan goods at an Iranian port for shipment to the United States\" would be within the scope of transactions \"ordinarily incident\" to the licensed importation of \"Irianian-origin\" goods (560.405). 560.405 states that a transaction ordinarily incident to licensed transaction excludes the provision:  \"of any transportation services to or from Iran not explicitly authorized in or pursuant to this part other than loading, transporting, and discharging licensed or exempt cargo there.\"  4) Guidance clarifies that while the transshipment of the Afghan item does not taint the item for the purposes of eligibility for the importation GL, transshipping the item to or through Iran would not be permissible for a U.S. person. This is an implied interpretation of 560.405. Even if the most efficient way of bringing the imports into the U.S. would be to send them overland to an Iranian port and ship them from there, the sending them through is not ordinarily incident to the licensed import, even if the loading them onto a ship in Iran would be. Note the statement of licensing policy, however.  4) OFAC notes that once an item becomes \"Iranian origin\" within the meaning of 560.306, U.S. persons may not only import those items, but they may not even engage in transactions \"related to\" those items. 560.534(b) as it was then in force specifically permitted offshore dealings in goods otherwise eligible for importation into the U.S.  5) OFAC states that \"U.S. persons, wherever located, are prohibited from engaging in or facilitating the transshipment of any goods through Iran or entering into a contract for the exportation of goods to Iran.\" Entry into a contract is prohibited (presumably by 560.206) where the contract is for activities that are themselves prohibited by the ITSR. The contract need not involve an Iranian person.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

You state in your Application that you and your husband recently relocated to the United States through the [        ]. You therefore seek guidance on the requirements of transferring your personal funds and assets from Iran to the United States.  The Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the \"ITR\"), generally prohibit the importation into the United States of any goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. ITR, § 560.201. The ITR also generally prohibit the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply of any goods, technology, or services, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITR, § 560.204. Additionally, the ITR generally prohibit U.S. persons, wherever located, from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to (1) goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; or (2) goods, technology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITR, § 560.206(a). This prohibition includes but is not limited to purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing. ITR,§ 560.206(b). The ITR define the term U.S. person to mean any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. ITR, § 560.314.  Section 560.550 of the ITSR generally authorizes the transfer of a noncommercial, personal remittance to or from Iran or for or on behalf of an individual ordinarily resident in Iran, other than an individual whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 560.211 of the ITSR, provided that the transfer is processed by a United States depository institution or a United States registered broker or dealer in securities and not by any other U.S. person; does not involve debiting or crediting an Iranian account; and is not by, to, or through the Government of Iran, as defined in section 560.304 of the ITSR.  Further, the ITSR authorize United States depository institutions to process transfers of funds to or from Iran, or for the direct or indirect benefit of persons in Iran or the Government of Iran, if the transfer arises from, and is ordinarily incident and necessary to give effect to, an underlying transaction that has been authorized by a general license, such as sections 560.543 and 560.550 of the ITSR, and does not involve debiting or crediting an Iranian account. ITSR, § 560.516(a). Please be advised further that the ITSR do not authorize transactions that would be prohibited by a different sanctions program administered by OFAC, such as current restrictions under the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 544) (\"WMDPSR\") or the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 594) (\"GTSR\"), pursuant to which certain banks are designated, including but not limited to Ansar Bank, Bank of Industry and Mine, Bank Mellat, Bank Melli, Bank Refah, Bank Saderat, Bank Sepah, Bank Tejarat, Europaisch-Iranische Handelsbank, Export Development Bank of Iran, Future Bank B.S.C., Kargoshaee Bank, Mehr Bank, or Post Bank of Iran (\"designated banks\"). See ITSR, § 560.101; see also 31 C.F.R. §§ 544.201 and 594.201.  Although the authorities described above allow the transfer of noncommercial personal remittances from Iran to the United States without a specific license from OFAC. The maintenance of a bank account in Iran by a U.S. person is prohibited and does require a specific license. If you or your husband still maintains a bank account in Iran, you may apply for a specific license to close the account(s).

Settles Potential Civil Liability for Apparent Violations of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations: IPSA International Services, Inc. (IPSA), Phoenix, Arizona, has agreed to pay $259,200 to settle its potential civil liability for 72 apparent violations of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 560 (ITSR).[1] The apparent violations involve, on 44 separate occasions, IPSA’s importation of Iranian-origin services into the United States in apparent violation of § 560.201 of the ITSR, and on 28 separate occasions, IPSA’s engagement in transactions or dealings related to Iranian-origin services by approving and facilitating its foreign subsidiaries’ payments to providers of Iranian-origin services in apparent violation of §§ 560.206 and 560.208 of the ITSR.  OFAC determined that IPSA did not voluntarily disclose the apparent violations, and that the apparent violations constitute a non-egregious case. The total transaction value of the apparent violations was $290,784. The statutory maximum civil penalty amount in this case was $18,000,000, and the base civil penalty amount was $720,000.  IPSA is a global business investigative and regulatory risk mitigation firm that provides due diligence services for various countries and their citizenship by investment programs. In March 2012, IPSA entered into an engagement letter and fee agreement with a third country with respect to its citizenship by investment program (\"Contract No. 1\"). In October 2012, IPSA’s subsidiary in Vancouver, Canada (\"IPSA Canada\") entered into a similar contract with a government-owned financial institution in a separate third country (\"Contract No. 2\"). While the majority of the applicants to both of these programs were nationals from countries not subject to OFAC sanctions, some were Iranian nationals. Since most of the information about Iranian applicants could not be checked or verified by sources outside Iran, IPSA Canada and IPSA’s subsidiary in Dubai, United Arab Emirates subsequently hired subcontractors to conduct the necessary due diligence in Iran, and those subcontractors in turn hired third parties to validate information that could only be obtained or verified within Iran. Although it was IPSA’s foreign subsidiaries that managed and performed both Contract No. 1 and Contract No. 2, with regard to Contract No. 1, IPSA appears to have imported Iranian-origin services into the United States because the foreign subsidiaries conducted the due diligence in Iran on behalf of and for the benefit of IPSA. With regard to Contract No. 2, IPSA also appears to have engaged in transactions or dealings related to Iranian-origin services and facilitated the foreign subsidiaries’ engagement in such transactions or dealings because IPSA reviewed, approved, and initiated the foreign subsidiaries’ payments to providers of the Iranian-origin services.  The settlement amount reflects OFAC’s consideration of the following facts and circumstances, pursuant to the General Factors under OFAC’s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. part 501, app. A. OFAC considered the following to be aggravating factors: (1) IPSA failed to exercise a minimal degree of caution or care when it imported background investigation services of Iranian origin into the United States and when it reviewed, approved, and initiated its foreign subsidiaries’ payments to providers of Iranian-origin services, and the frequency and duration of the apparent violations constitute a pattern or practice of conduct; (2) at least one of IPSA’s senior management knew or had reason to know that it was importing and/or engaging in transactions or dealings related to services of Iranian origin; (3) the transactions giving rise to the apparent violations resulted in economic benefits to Iran, and the conduct underlying the apparent violations is not eligible for OFAC authorization under existing licensing policy2; (4) IPSA is a commercially sophisticated company operating internationally with experience in U.S. sanctions; and (5) IPSA’s OFAC compliance program was ineffective in that it did not recognize or react to the risks presented by engaging in transactions that involved Iranian-origin background investigation services.  OFAC considered the following to be mitigating factors: (1) IPSA has no prior OFAC sanctions history in the five years preceding the earliest date of the transactions giving rise to the apparent violations; (2) IPSA undertook significant remedial measures by taking swift action to cease the prohibited activities, conducting an investigation to discover the causes and extent of the apparent violations, and adopting new internal controls and procedures to prevent reoccurrence of the apparent violations; and (3) IPSA substantially cooperated with OFAC’s investigation by conducting an internal look-back investigation for potential sanctions violations and submitting an investigation report to OFAC without receiving an administrative subpoena, promptly providing detailed additional information and documentation in a well-organized manner in response to OFAC’s multiple requests for information, and entering into a statute of limitations tolling agreement.  For more information regarding OFAC regulations, please go to: http://www.treasury.gov/ofac.  [1]On October 22, 2012, OFAC changed the heading of 31 C.F.R. part 560 from the Iranian Transactions Regulations to the ITSR, amended the renamed ITSR, and reissued them in their entirety. See 77 Fed. Reg. 64,664 (Oct. 22, 2012). For the sake of clarity, all references herein to the ITSR shall mean the regulations in 31 C.F.R. part 560 in effect at the time of the activity, regardless of whether such activity occurred before or after the regulations were renamed.  [2] On January 16, 2016, OFAC issued General License H: Authorizing Certain Transactions Relating to Foreign Entities Owned or Controlled by a United States Person (\"GL H\"). GL H authorizes, subject to certain conditions, an entity owned or controlled by a U.S. person and established or maintained outside the United States to engage in transactions with any person subject to the jurisdiction of the Government of Iran that would otherwise be prohibited by 31 C.F.R. § 560.215. Under GL H, however, U.S. persons are authorized to engage only in limited activities with regard to U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities, and the general prohibition of facilitation remains in place. In addition, OFAC’s January 12, 2017 Guidance on the Provision of Certain Services Relating to the Requirements of U.S. Sanctions Laws notes that U.S. persons may solicit information from covered persons and conduct research to make a determination as to the legality of transactions under U.S. sanctions laws only if \"there is no importation of services where the importation of services is prohibited by any part of 31 C.F.R. chapter V.\"\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:   1) The timing of these contracts and activities relative to Executive Order 13628 of October 9, 2012, and entry into force of 560.215--both of which extended ITSR jurisdiction to subsidiaries of U.S. persons--may appear relevant, but the extension of jurisdiction issue seems to be a red herring in this case. The result would have been the same with or without the expansion of jurisdiction.  With respect to Contract 1: The ultimate contractual beneficiary of all the activities undertaken pursuant to that contract is a U.S. person, and it would not matter how many layers of subcontractors separated the U.S. contracting party and the Iranian-origin services from which the U.S. person indirectly benefitted. All such services would constitute an \"indirect\" import of services (560.201), the separation between the U.S. entity and the Iranian service providers only determines just how indirect the importation would have been.   Irrespective of how many layers of subsidiaries and subcontractors separated IPSA from the Iranians providing the diligence services, the activity described would have been considered an indirect import of Iranian origin services (560.201) for Contract 1.   For Contract 2, OFAC does not seem to say that the Canadian entities violated the ITSR.  Rather, it was the U.S. parent's facilitative involvement in the dealings between the Canadian subsidiary and the Iranian origin services that constituted an ordinary case of facilitation (560.206) and trade-related transactions involving Iranian-origin services (560.206).   Were 560.215 to have applied to the Canadian entity in this case (it seems as though it did not given the timing), then the Canadian entity would have committed separate violations of the ITSR.    2) Footnote 2, which seems a propos of nothing given that the services at issue here were not related to compliance with sanctions laws, seems designed to put on the public record OFAC's view, not entirely clear on the basis of the Compliance Services Guidance referred to in the footnote, that the unlicensed engagement of Iranian service providers of any kind is in principle considered an \"importation of services\" within the meaning of 560.201.  3) OFAC does not state that IPSA exported a service (560.204) in working for the benefit of an Iranian national. In all likelihood, this was not, in and of itself, a violation of the ITSR. Per OFAC's usual practice, if that person was not ordinarily resident in Iran at the time of the provision of the services, IPSA did not export a service \"to Iran.\"   4) As a blanket statement concerning the relationship between Iran-sourced due diligence services and the ITSR, one should avoid reading this enforcement action too broadly. The Canadian citizenship program was not prohibited by the ITSR, but it was not licensed either. There are some scenarios in which the importation of Iranian-origin due diligence services may be considered \"ordinarily incident\" to transactions that are actually generally or specifically licensed by OFAC; but only when the underlying transaction is covered by a prohibition of the ITSR at the threshold level.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Box 312  Stormville, NY 12582  Dear [        ]:  This responds to your request dated September 30, 2013 (the \"Application\"), on behalf of DBA Numisphere (\"Numisphere\"), to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), in which you request information regarding the applicability of OFAC-administered sanctions to certain transactions involving the collection of old coins from Cuba and Iran (\"Coin Currency of Sanctioned Countries\"). According to your Application, Numisphere acquires Coin Currency of Sanctioned Countries by purchasing them from other collectors in the United States, from other U.S. coin dealers, or at public auctions either in the United States or the international market. Also, according to your Application, you do not acquire Coin Currency of Sanctioned Countries directly from embargoed countries or from nationals of those countries either in the United States or abroad. However, your Application states that it has come to your attention that certain electronic payment services have denied transactions involving Coin Currency of Sanctioned Countries claiming such transactions are in violation of OFAC regulations. Therefore, you request clarification and guidance on whether it is the intent of OFAC to regulate or prohibit trade in Coin Currency of Sanctioned Countries.  The Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515 (CACR), prohibit all persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States from purchasing, transporting, importing, or otherwise dealing in or engaging in any transaction with respect to any merchandise outside the United States if such merchandise (1) is of Cuban origin; or (2) is or has been located in or transported from or through Cuba; or (3) is made or derived in whole or in part of any article which is the growth, produce or manufacture of Cuba. CACR, §§ 515.204(a), 515.410. Merchandise is defined by the CACR as all goods, wares, and chattels of every description without limitation of any kind. CACR, § 515.331. OFAC views Cuban coins as falling within the scope of this prohibition. Accordingly, transactions by a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction in Cuban coins would require a license. OFAC would consider licensing the importation of Cuban coins for personal collection where satisfactory proof exists that the coins were in existence prior to July 8, 1963 and that there has been no Cuban interest in the coins since that date. See CACR, § 515.543.  The Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (ITSR), generally prohibit the importation of goods or services from Iran, or of Iranian-origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.201. OFAC views Iranian coins as falling within the scope of this prohibition. However, other than transactions involving the Government of Iran, an Iranian financial institution, or any other person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 560.211 of the ITSR, section 560.518 of the ITSR authorizes: (1) all domestic transactions with respect to Iranian-origin goods located in the United States; (2) transactions by a U.S. person with third-country nationals incidental to the storage and maintenance in third countries of Iranian-origin goods owned prior to May 7, 1995, by that U.S. person or acquired thereafter by that United States person consistent with the provisions of the ITSR; (3) exportation of Iranian-origin household and personal effects from the United States incident to the relocation of U.S. persons outside the United States; and (4) the use or disposition by a U.S. person of Iranian-origin household and personal effects that are located outside the United States and that have been acquired by the U.S. person in transactions not prohibited by the Iranian Assets Control Regulations, 31 CF.R. Part 535 or the ITSR. ITSR, § 560.518. However, all other transactions involving Iranian-origin coins would be prohibited unless specifically licensed.  If you have any additional questions about the CACR, the ITSR, or about the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, you may refer to our website at www.treasury.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.  Sincerely,  Davin J. Blackborow  [March 7, 2016] Assistant Director for Licensing  Office of Foreign Assets Control \n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1)  Note the amount of time it took for OFAC to respond to the applicant, generally indicating a need for interagency review and/or the guidance being precedential in some fashion. In this case, OFAC addresses questions concerning \"certain transactions involving the collection of old coins from Cuba and Iran.\" But way the response is phrased, in terms of \"Coin Currency of Sanctioned Countries,\" appears to mean that the guidance is not limited to \"old\" currency.   2)  Two central, threshold questions here are whether \"Coin Currency of Sanctioned Countries\" constitute \"merchandise\" for the purposes of the CACR and \"goods\" for the purposes of the ITSR. Note that ‘funds’ in general are not goods or merchandise. For example, if a U.S. bank receives a wire from an Iranian bank, the funds in the U.S. account are not \"goods\" or Iranian origin. OFAC concludes that \"Coin Currency of Sanctioned Countries\" (CCSC) is ‘merchandise’ for the purposes of the CACR and ‘goods’ for the purposes of the ITSR. This means that the CCSC cannot be imported by U.S. persons or otherwise dealt in outside of the U.S.   3)  The most notable determination in the guidance letter is the implicit ‘no interest’ determination in the statement that 560.518 of the ITSR would authorize domestic transactions involving Iranian coins already brought into the U.S. Does the Government of Iran not necessarily have an interest in coin currency minted by itself? Apparently not.   4)   Read in conjunction with Case No. IA-2018-355540-1 (similar but with Iranian-origin banknotes, not coins).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

The apparent violations were committed between February 2016 and March 2016 when U.S. Person-1 accepted payment in the United States on behalf of an Iran-based company selling Iranian-origin cement clinker to another company for a project in a third country.  Description of the Conduct Leading to the Apparent Violations  Over a two-month period in 2016, U.S. Person-1 arranged for, and received, four payments totaling $133,860 into his personal bank account in the United States on behalf of an Iranian cement company. These payments were for Iranian-origin clinker, a cement precursor, that the Iranian company supplied to a project in a third country. U.S. person-1 coordinated and further facilitated the sale of the clinker with a family member working at the Iranian cement company by relaying logistical and shipping information to the purchasing company.  U.S. Person-1 knew or had reason to know that accepting payments for or on behalf of the Iranian cement company and that facilitating the export of goods from Iran was prohibited. Previously, U.S. Person-1 had submitted a license request to OFAC to authorize other transactions with Iran; that request was denied. In its denial letter to U.S. Person-1, OFAC listed and detailed the prohibitions involving Iran. U.S. person-1 also received information from the Iranian company that identified the sanctions imposed against Iran and described complications the Iranian company had faced when attempting to receive U.S. dollar payments in the past. OFAC did not find that U.S. Person-1 received significant, if any, financial benefits from their conduct. In accepting the payments and coordinating the sale, U.S. Person-1 appears to have violated §§ 560.204, 560.206, and 560.208 of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 560 (\"ITSR\") on at least four occasions, specifically through:  1)  exporting financial services to a company in Iran; 2)  engaging in transactions or dealings related to the sale of Iranian-origin clinker on behalf of an Iranian company; and 3)  facilitating four transactions that violate the prohibitions of §§ 560.204 and 560.206.  Although U.S. Person-1’s facilitation of the payments involved a family member, § 560.550 of the ITSR generally authorizes certain personal remittances to or from Iran only if the transactions are \"noncommercial.\" OFAC found the underlying transactions to be commercial, and thus unavailable for the authorization found in § 560.550.   Penalty Calculations and General Factors Analysis  The statutory maximum civil monetary penalty applicable in this matter is $1,210,336. OFAC determined that U.S. Person-1 did not voluntarily self-disclose the Apparent Violations, and that the Apparent Violations constitute an egregious case. Accordingly, under OFAC’s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines (\"Enforcement Guidelines\"), the base civil monetary penalty amount applicable in this matter is $1,210,336.  The settlement amount of $133,860 reflects OFAC’s consideration of the General Factors under the Enforcement Guidelines.  OFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:  (1)  U.S. Person-1 willfully violated or recklessly ignored U.S. sanctions on Iran when receiving payments on behalf of an Iranian company; (2)  U.S. Person-1 was aware of, and actively participated in, the conduct constituting the Apparent Violations; and (3)  U.S. Person-1 harmed the objectives of the ITSR by enabling the evasion of sanctions by an Iranian company.  OFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors:  (1)  U.S. Person-1 has not received a penalty notice, finding of violation, or cautionary letter from OFAC in the five years preceding the earliest date of the transactions giving rise to the apparent violations; and (2)  U.S. Person-1 is a natural person, who received minimal if any economic benefits from the transactions and presented evidence regarding financial difficulties affecting the person’s ability to pay.  Compliance Considerations  This enforcement action highlights the broad range of prohibitions on dealings with Iran for natural U.S. persons, including those who act as intermediaries between non-U.S. parties. U.S. sanctions on Iran encompass a wide range of conduct, including dealings in goods of Iranian origin, providing services to Iran or persons normally resident in Iran, and facilitating other prohibited activity. OFAC’s regulations and enforcement actions make clear that all U.S. persons face significant risks of violating U.S. sanctions when engaging in such dealings.  At the same time, OFAC’s regulations authorize or exempt specified activities that promote or are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and national security interests, such as exceptions for transactions involving humanitarian goods, certain communications technology, informational exchange, and personal remittances. To avail themselves of these authorizations, however, U.S. persons must ensure that their conduct is consistent with their scope. As this action illustrates, most non-humanitarian commercial activity falls outside OFAC’s authorizations. Similarly, it is essential that U.S. persons seeking to transmit personal remittances to or from Iran or other sanctioned jurisdictions ensure there is no intertwined commercial activity.  OFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources  On May 2, 2019, OFAC published A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments in order to provide organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in or with the United States or U.S. persons, or that use U.S.-origin goods or services, with OFAC’s perspective on the essential components of a sanctions compliance program. The Framework also outlines how OFAC may incorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations and resolution of investigations resulting in settlements. The Framework includes an appendix that offers a brief analysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs OFAC has identified during its investigative process.  Information concerning the civil penalties process can be found in the OFAC regulations governing each sanctions program; the Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 501; and the Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. part 501, app. A.

Compare ZAG IP, LLC, which also pertained to a dealing related to \"Iranian origin clinker\" located in a third country. The facilitation of a dealing in such goods—even where no Iranian person is involved in the transaction—violates 560.206 and 560.208 (facilitation) of the ITSR.   In this case, there were also violations of 560.204 (\"exporting financial services to a company in Iran\"), because the U.S. person individual engaged in financial transactions for the benefit of a person (the Iranian cement company) in Iran.   OFAC notes that the U.S. person received the payment from a third country for the benefit of the Iranian company, but that receipt of the payment is characterized as an \"exportation\" of a financial service to Iran because it was for the benefit of the Iranian company. OFAC does not say that the funds were forwarded onward to Iran, and OFAC does say that it \"did not find that U.S. Person-1 received significant, if any, financial benefits from their conduct.\" Given that the penalty amount in this case was $133,860, i.e. the same exact amount that was deposited into the U.S. person’s account on behalf of the Iranian entity, it is fairly evident that the funds were never forwarded onward to the Iranian entity. Instead, they were used to pay the fine. This may be the only case in which arranging for and/or the actual receipt of payments from a third country, without any further forwarding on the funds elsewhere, was deemed an \"exportation\" of a service to Iran. Note that there was no cited violation of 560.201 (importation of a service from Iran).   2)      INAPPLICABILITY OF THE REMITTANCE GL   The reference to 560.550 is a fairly straightforward statement concerning the scope of the \"remittance\" GL in the ITSR. See General Note on Remittances; Guidance Letters Concerning Personal Remittances. There are other cases involving remittances to and from family members that have been deemed outside the scope of the remittance GL, even where the underlying transaction is arguably non-commercial in nature (e.g. a loan from one family member to another).   3)      \"NORMALLY RESIDENT\" = \"ORDINARILY RESIDENT\"   Prior to the 2012 reissuance of the ITR as the ITSR, OFAC used the terms \"normally resident in Iran\" and \"normally located in Iran\" to characterize the individuals to whom the exportation of services would constitute the exportation of services \"to Iran\". (See e.g. 560.419 (1999-2012)); Case No. IA-15392). The term now used is \"ordinarily resident\". OFAC has never explicitly stated that the terms \"ordinarily\" and \"normally\" mean the same thing, but this has always appeared to be the case. OFAC’s use of the term \"normally resident\" here should confirm that there is no difference between \"normally resident\" and \"ordinarily resident,\" as it relates to persons to whom the provision of services would constitute the exportation of services \"to Iran\". Note that this appears to be the first item that OFAC has published since at least Oct. 2012 that uses the term \"normally resident\".   4)      \"REASON TO KNOW\" IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LAW (AS OPPOSED TO THE FACTS)   Note OFAC’s citation of a previous denial letter—which presumably contained the same paragraph that recites the basic prohibitions of the ITSR that one finds in typical guidance letters—for the proposition that the individual \"knew or had reason to know\" about the prohibitions of the ITSR. That OFAC cites the denial letter as an aggravating factor is notable in its own right, but the context of the \"know or reason to know\" statement is also notable insofar as it relates to the law itself, rather than the facts underlying the transaction that gave rise to the violation.   OFAC has stated that \"OFAC may impose civil penalties for sanctions violations based on strict liability, meaning that a person may be held civilly liable even if it did not know or have reason to know it was engaging in prohibited conduct.\" (See e.g. Updated Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risks for Facilitating Ransomware Payments). Given that OFAC has never (stated that it has) imposed a penalty on a person that was ignorant of the underlying facts giving rise to a violation, but where that person had otherwise met OFAC’s due diligence standards, it was not clear whether that statement is meant to refer to strict liability notwithstanding ignorance of the law itself. In this case, OFAC clearly uses \"reason to know\" in reference to the applicable legal requirements, rather than the facts giving rise to a violation.  Compare ENF 50908 (Cautionary Letter). The two cases have quite a bit in common (U.S. person Iranians engaging in ITSR violations in connection with commercial transactions connected to family members). A key distinguishing factor, however, is that the person in here had actual knowledge of the requirements of the ITSR, whereas the individual at issue in ENF 50908 was virtually certain to have been unaware of the requirements of the law, both at the time of the violations as well as the time of the filing of the civil complaint in which those violations were admitted.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

  "answer": "It depends. According to [Case No. IA-2018-355540-1], the basic prohibition under the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR) is that the importation into the United States of Iranian‑origin goods is generally prohibited. However, OFAC has clarified that if the banknotes are no longer valid currency—that is, if they have been demonetized—they may qualify as informational materials. In that circumstance, their importation (and exportation) from or to another country can be exempt from the prohibition. \n\nAt the same time, the guidance explains that if a transaction is “wholly domestic” within the United States, then even demonetized banknotes may fall outside the informational materials exemption and would normally require specific OFAC authorization pursuant to section 560.518 of the ITSR. Likewise, if the banknotes still constitute valid currency, they would not qualify for the informational materials exemption and any importation (or domestic dealings) would be prohibited unless specifically licensed by OFAC.\n\nIn summary, Iranian‑origin banknotes can be imported into the United States only if one of the following conditions applies:\n • They are no longer valid currency (i.e., they have been demonetized) and the transaction is conducted as an export/import of informational materials; or\n • They are part of a domestic transaction that meets the requirements of section 560.518 of the ITSR (with the same demonetized status);\notherwise, if the banknotes retain their status as valid currency, their importation is prohibited unless a specific OFAC license is obtained.\n\nThis explanation is based on the determinations and commentary set forth in [Case No. IA-2018-355540-1]."
