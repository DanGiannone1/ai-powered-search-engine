(1) The importation from any country and the exportation to any country of information or informational materials as defined in §515.332, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission, are exempt from the prohibitions and regulations of this part except for payments owed to Cuba for telecommunications services between Cuba and the United States, which are subject to the provisions of §515.542. (2) This section does not authorize transactions related to information or informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transaction, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of information or informational materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services by a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Such prohibited transactions include, without limitation, payment of advances for information or informational materials not yet created and completed, provision of services to market, produce or co-produce, create or assist in the creation of information or informational materials, and payment of royalties to a designated national with respect to income received for enhancements or alterations made by persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to information or informational materials imported from a designated national. (3) This section does not authorize transactions incident to the transmission of restricted technical data as defined in the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730-774, or to the exportation of goods for use in the transmission of any data. The exportation of such goods to designated foreign countries is prohibited, as provided in §515.201 of this part and §785.1 of the Export Administration Regulations. (4) This section does not authorize transactions related to travel to Cuba when such travel is not otherwise authorized under §515.545. Note to paragraph (a): See §515.545 for general licenses authorizing certain travel-related and other transactions that are directly incident to the export, import, or transmission of informational materials and certain transactions related to the creation, dissemination, or artistic or other substantive alteration or enhancement of informational materials. (b) Donation of food. The prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to transactions incident to the donation of food to nongovernmental organizations or individuals in Cuba.

Note) for discussion of the scope of the term \"Informational materials\"  1) INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS  a) The scope of the informational materials exemption of the sort found here has been interpreted identically across programs. The Research System contains over 100 guidance letters, interpretive rulings, FAQs and other documents addressing the various interpretive issues that have come up with regard to the exemption. Refer to, e.g. Examples of the \"Substantive or Artistic Alteration or Enhancement\" and \"Fully Created and in Existence\" Standards, Notes Common to the \"Information or informational materials\" Definitional Provision, Notable Applications of the Definition of \"Information or Informational Materials\" and Examples of Transactions Exempt as Incident to Underlying Informational Materials Transactions.  b) To the extent that transactions are not covered by the basic informational materials exemption, the CACR contain a GL for publishing that, with certain limitations, vastly exceeds the scope of the basic informational materials exemption. That GL is similar to the publishing GLs contained in the SySR and ITSR, and there are several public and private guidance letters available interpreting the scope of the GL.   c) In addition, the CACR contain a GL (515.545) authorizing \"certain travel-related and other transactions that are directly incident to the export, import, or transmission of informational materials and certain transactions related to the creation, dissemination, or artistic or other substantive alteration or enhancement of informational materials.\" This GL is unique to the CACR insofar as it provides an alternate basis for certain transactions outside the scope of both the basic informational materials exemption and the publishing GLs. See Case No. CU-2015-318654-1, comments thereto.   d) 515.206(a)(3) and the reference to \"technical data as defined in the Export Administration Regulations\" is unique to the CACR and out of date as \"technology\" is the more relevant defined term (\"technical data\" is no longer a defined term in the EAR at all). Modern sanctions regulations convey the idea as follows, in a way that more accurately captures the scope of the provision:  \"This section does not exempt transactions incident to the exportation of software subject to the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730 through 774, or to the exportation of goods (including software) or technology for use in the transmission of any data, or to the provision, sale, or leasing of capacity on telecommunications transmission facilities (such as satellite or terrestrial network connectivity) for use in the transmission of any data. The exportation of such items or services and the provision, sale, or leasing of such capacity or facilities to a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to §547.201(a) are prohibited.\"  2) DONATIONS:   The CACR is one of only three programs containing a donation exemption, but note that it only applies to food, as opposed to, in the case of the ITSR, \"articles, such as food, clothing, and medicine, intended to be used to relieve human suffering.\" The reason for this is that the source of the exemption is the CDA (Sec. 1705), rather than the humanitarian exemption of IEEPA, as is the case with the ITSR. Refer to the BIS rules for the scope of what constitutes \"food\" for the purposes of the exemption.   3) PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS:  Of the 15 sanctions programs with explicit implementations of \"Berman Amendment\" exemptions, the CACR is the only one to not have an explicit \"personal communications\" provision. The apparent reason for this is that the \"Berman Amendment\" for TWEA—of which the IEEPA version exempted personal communications, informational materials, travel and donations—did not need to and could not explicitly exempt \"personal communications\" for the case of Cuba. Unlike IEEPA, provisions of the TWEA dating back to 1917 do, in certain circumstances, allow for the regulation of \"personal communication,\" but in the case of the Cuban embargo, 50 USC §4303(a) provides that communications \"in the regular courts of the mail\" are not regulated. Further, 50 USC §4302 (Definitions) defines \"trade\" to mean, in part \"[t]o have any form of business or commercial communication or intercourse with.\" Although OFAC does not seem to have pronounced on the issue and there is no legislative history clarifying it, this appears to be the basis for the proposition that \"personal communications\" are outside the scope of/not prohibited by the CACR, but are not necessarily \"exempt from regulation\" in the way that they are with regard to IEEPA.   In any event, the general license at 515.542 (Mail and telecommunications-related transactions) goes far beyond the typical \"personal communications\" exemption, permitting, for example, \"payments, incident to the establishment of facilities, including fiber-optic cable and satellite facilities, to provide telecommunications services linking the United States or third countries and Cuba.\"  4) Transactions incident to the export/import of informational materials and food:   While OFAC has always treated transactions (e.g. shipping, payment processing) ordinarily incident to informational materials transactions as exempt, the CACR appears to be the only place where this is explicitly written.   Note 1 to §515.559 confirms: \"Transactions by U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign firms directly incident to the exportation of information or informational materials or the donation of food to nongovernmental entities or individuals in Cuba are exempt from the prohibitions of this part. See §515.206...\"  Note that the statement confirms that such \"directly incident\" transactions may be engaged in by all persons subject to the prohibitions of the CACR, and there is nothing to suggest that any of the parties to the underlying transaction need to be persons subject to the prohibitions of the CACR. This is consistent with OFAC's practice in the exemption context generally.  5) TRANSACTIONS ORDINARILY INCIDENT TO EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS, GENERALLY AND WITH RESPECT TO THE CACR IN PARTICULAR  To the degree that a transaction is exempt from regulation as a result of an IEEPA-mandated exemption (i.e. personal communications, informational materials, travel, (and sometimes donations)), all transactions incident to the exempt transactions are also, themselves, exempt. See Notes Common to the 400-Level Interpretive Provisions Authorizing Transactions \"Ordinarily Incident\" to a Licensed Transaction; Transactions Incident to Others in General (System Ed. Note). This is true whether or not the underlying transaction involves a U.S. person. See General Note and Associated Matrix Pertaining to U.S. Person Engagement in Transactions Incident to Transactions by Foreign Persons (System Ed. Note).  With respect to the CACR in particular, see § 515.206 - Exempt transactions (1999, Cuba). The \"examples\" found in that provision, of what constituted transactions within the scope of the Berman Amendment concerning informational materials, were first inserted in the CACR and FACR shortly after the original 1989 version of the Berman Amendment was enacted, and remained in the CACR up through 2016, when the relevance of the examples was diminished by the addition of a general license for, among other things, travel-related activities incident to informational materials transactions.   § 515.206 - Exempt transactions (1999, Cuba) confirms, for example, that direct shipments from the U.S. of exempt items to Cuba are exempt from regulation. The fact that the CACR have an informational materials exemption, but not a travel exemption, makes for some occasionally difficult interpretive questions that have, fortunately, been rendered less-important as a result of the GL for travel in connection with informational materials transactions. Still, it is worth keeping track of what travel-related transactions are considered exempt from the CACR as a result of the informational materials exemption. In addition to the example of the chartering of a plane to Cuba to deliver exempt informational materials, refer also to 020416-FACRL-CU-01- Computer Reservation Systems - Cuba [interpretive Rulings Removed From OFAC's website, comments on continued relevance], and comments thereto.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

(EBSCO), to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), requesting guidance on five questions related to the scope of the informational materials exemption. The Application states that EBSCO Information Services (EIS), a division of EBSCO, provides electronic and print subscriptions, resource management tools, full text and secondary databases, and related services for libraries, research organizations, and corporations worldwide. According to the Application, EIS acts as an agent by purchasing content from publishers and sending content to customers. EIS also processes payments and refunds and provides customer service. The Application states that all of the content EIS sells to customers is publicly available from the content provider and is not sold exclusively through EIS. The Application further states that EBSCO Publishing (EP), a separate division of EBSCO, provides access to electronic databases containing informational materials on various subjects to its subscribers. According to the Application, EP offers variations of access to content, which may include full text documents, abstracts, or indexes, depending on the customer’s subscription, and explains that customers would access such information through a text search feature. The Application states that EIS and EP offer their products globally, and occasionally have business opportunities in OFAC- sanctioned countries.  OFAC administers and enforces a number of U.S. economic sanctions programs that target specific countries, geographic regions, and governments, among them the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515 (CACR); the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (ITSR); the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 538 (SSR); and the Syrian Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 542 (SySR). Because of the broad nature of your request, our analysis focuses on OFAC’s country-based sanctions. OFAC also administers and enforces numerous narrower programs targeting specific individuals or entities. OFAC maintains a list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the \"SDN List\"), which is available at http://sdnsearch.ofac.treas.gov/. See generally, 31 C.F.R. Chapter V. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with blocked persons, including persons on the SDN List. If a U.S. person deals in the property or interests in property of an SDN or other person blocked pursuant to a list-based sanctions program, such as the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 594 (GTSR), or the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 598 (FNKSR), a separate analysis of the relevant sanctions program may be required because the statutory authorities on which these programs are based may include more limited statutory exemptions.  The SSR prohibit the exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, of any goods, technology (including technical data or software), or services to Sudan. SSR, § 538.205. However, effective January 17, 2017, OFAC amended the SSR to add at section 538.540 a new general license authorizing all transactions prohibited by the SSR and by E.O.s 13067 and 13412. The transactions authorized by section 538.540 include transactions involving property in which the Government of Sudan has an interest; processing transactions involving persons in Sudan; importing goods and services from Sudan; and exporting goods, technology, and services to Sudan. To the extent that the proposed activities described in the Application fall within the scope of the general license under section 538.540 of the SSR, you may proceed with your Sudan-related activities without further authorization from OFAC. Accordingly, the remainder of the guidance in this response addresses the Cuba, Iran, and Syria sanctions programs.  The CACR prohibit all persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction from any dealings in property in which Cuba or a Cuban national has an interest, unless authorized pursuant to a general or specific license issued under the CACR or otherwise exempt. CACR, § 515.201. The scope of property subject to the CACR is broad and includes \"contracts of any nature whatsoever, services, and any other property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, or interests therein, present, future, or contingent.\" CACR, § 515.311(a).  The ITSR prohibit the exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, of any goods, technology, or services to Iran or the Government of Iran. This prohibition includes the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply of goods, technology, or services to a person in a third country undertaken with knowledge or reason to know that such goods, technology, or services are intended specifically for Iran or the Government of Iran, or where such goods, technology, or services are intended specifically for use in the production of, for commingling with, or for incorporation into, goods, technology, or services destined exclusively or predominantly for Iran. ITSR, § 560.204. The ITSR further prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to goods, technology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.206. Finally, the ITSR prohibit the facilitation by a U.S. person of transactions by a foreign person if the transaction by the foreign person would be prohibited if performed by a United States person. ITSR, § 560.208.  The SySR prohibit the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a U.S. person, wherever located, of any services to Syria. SySR, § 542.207. The SySR also prohibit any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a U.S. person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by section 542.207 if performed by a U.S. person or within the United States. SySR, § 542.210.  However, the importation from any country and the exportation to any country of information and informational materials, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission, are exempt from the prohibitions of the CACR, ITSR, and SySR (the \"Regulations\"). See CACR, § 515.206(a); ITSR, § 560.210(c); SySR, § 542.211(b). The term information and informational materials includes publications, films, posters, phonograph records, photographs, microfilms, microfiche, tapes, compact disks, CD ROMs, artworks, news wire feeds, and other information and informational materials. See CACR, § 515.332(a); ITSR, § 560.315(a); SySR, § 542.307(a).  Please note that the information and informational materials exemption does not exempt from the Regulations transactions related to items not fully created and in existence at the date of the transaction, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials, and the exemption does not apply to the provision of marketing and business consulting services. See CACR, § 515.206(a)(2); ITSR, § 560.210(c)(2); SySR, § 542.211(b)(2).  Furthermore, the Regulations do not exempt from regulation or authorize the exportation of software subject to the EAR.   See  CACR,  §  515.206(a)(3);  ITSR,  § 560.210(c)(3);  SySR,  §  542.211(b)(3).  Additionally, the definition of information and informational materials generally does not include items subject to export controls under Section 5 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) or under Section 6 of the EAA to the extent that such controls promote the non-proliferation or antiterrorism policies of the United States.  See CACR, § 515.332(b); ITSR, § 560.315(b); SySR, § 542.307(b).  In response to your first question, based upon the limited information provided in the Application, OFAC is unable to determine whether all of the activities in which EIS and EP are engaged would fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption. However, EBSCO, EIS, and EP would generally not be prohibited from providing electronic and print subscriptions, as well as electronic access to full text and secondary databases, to customers in Cuba, Iran, or Syria, provided that such information and informational materials are fully created and in existence at the date of the transaction, and that EBSCO, EIS, and EP do not provide substantive or artistic alterations or enhancements to the materials. Additionally, the information and informational materials exemption does not authorize the exportation of software subject to the EAR.  In response to your second question, the information and informational materials exemption is generally available for sanctions programs based solely on the authorities of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), including more targeted sanctions programs. However, sanctions programs issued under other legal authorities may not include this exemption. For example, the information and informational materials exemption does not apply to transactions involving individuals or entities designated under the GTSR or FNKSR.  In response to your third question, the availability of the information and informational materials exemption does not turn on the topics or subject matter of the relevant information. However, as noted above, certain export-controlled items are carved out of the definition of information and informational materials.  In response to your fourth question, to the extent that the informational materials exemption applies to a particular transaction, it generally would exempt such a transaction from all prohibitions of the relevant sanctions program, including the prohibitions on transactions with persons included on the SDN List under that program.  In response to your fifth question we refer you to OFAC's Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines. See Appendix A to 31 C.F.R. Part 501.  Finally, if you are unsure whether any specific transaction meets the requirements set forth above, please provide OFAC with the specific facts regarding the transaction, and we will be happy to provide you with further guidance. If you have any additional questions, you may refer to the OFAC website at www.treasur.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.  Sincerely  [July 17, 2017]  Davin J. Blackborow Assistant Director for Licensing  Office of Foreign Assets Control\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1)  BACKGROUND   This guidance letter contains important determinations concerning the scope of the informational materials exemption (IME), as well as OFAC’s policy concerning the applicability of the IME in general.   As described in the letter EBSCO and EIS provide a variety of services, and this includes \"electronic and print subscriptions, as well as electronic access to full text and secondary databases\". The \"content…may include full text documents, abstracts, or indexes, depending on the customer’s subscription, and…customers would access such information through a text search feature.\" Note that \"secondary databases\" are those which contain data that is delivered by and licensed from another publisher or database provider. The secondary database operator acts as a sort of data broker, though the secondary database operators are typically more focused on enhancing the value and usability of the data for specific applications, often within academic, research, or specialized industry contexts.  2)  APPLICABILITY OF IEEPA EXEMPTIONS IN LIST-BASED SANCTIONS PROGRAM CONTEXT  Consistent with Case No. MUL-372-1 (similar), OFAC confirms that \"the information and informational materials exemption is generally available for sanctions programs based solely on the authorities of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), including more targeted sanctions programs\". This is confirmation that IEEPA exemptions apply across the board (notwithstanding the existence of regulations). See also comments to 542.201, implicitly confirming that this position remains valid as of 6-5-24, and see generally General Note on the Applicability of IEEPA/TWEA Exemptions in EOs and Sanctions Regulations not Specifically Mentioning Them.   3)  IME IN THE DATABASE CONTEXT  The guidance confirms OFAC’s longstanding position that commercial access to information via internet based search functionality is included within the scope of the informational materials exemption.  Compare Case No. IA-2012-293259-1 and Case No. IA-2013-303560-1. An important question not addressed by any of these guidance letters is what types of basic customer support (e.g. help logging in) would be exempt as incident to the exportation of the informational materials in the database.    4)  \"REFUNDS\" IN THE IME CONTEXT  The guidance letter says that \"EIS also processes payments and refunds and provides customer service\". It is well established that processing of payments in connection with underlying exempt informational materials transactions is exempt from regulation (see e.g. Case No. IA-2012-299245-1), but what about refunds? This is a question that OFAC has not directly addressed in the exemption context.  5)  CONTENT NEUTRALITY AND IME APPLYING TO ALL IEEPA PROHIBITIONS  In an important statement which appears to be the only of its kind as of the uploading of this guidance letter to the Research System, OFAC confirms that \"the availability of the information and informational materials exemption does not turn on the topics or subject matter of the relevant information. However, as noted above, certain export-controlled items are carved out of the definition of information and informational materials.\" This is an important clarification that, so long as an item otherwise meeting the definition of \"information\" is not subject to export controls,  the IME \"does not turn on the topics or subject matter of the relevant information\".   In a similar vein, OFAC states that \"to the extent that the informational materials exemption applies to a particular transaction, it generally would exempt such a transaction from all prohibitions of the relevant sanctions program, including the prohibitions on transactions with persons included on the SDN List under that program\".  If, for example, a U.S. person provides \"information\" to a sanctioned or non-sanctioned person with actual knowledge that the information will be used in connection with sanctions-implicating transactions that the provider of the information could not engage in directly, this does not constitute prohibited \"facilitation\". Provision of the information may well \"facilitate\" a prohibited transaction, but such facilitation is exempt from regulation. The transfer of the information is \"exempt…from all prohibitions of the relevant sanctions program,\" including the facilitation prohibition, the \"conspiracy\" prohibition, and all others.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Refer to, e.g. Examples of the \"Substantive or Artistic Alteration or Enhancement\" and \"Fully Created and in Existence\" Standards, Notes Common to the \"Information or informational materials\" Definitional Provision, Notable Applications of the Definition of \"Information or Informational Materials\" and Examples of Transactions Exempt as Incident to Underlying Informational Materials Transactions.  2) TRAVEL   a) The scope of the exemption for travel and transactions ordinarily incident thereto been interpreted identically across programs. The Research System contains a multitude of guidance letters, interpretive rulings, FAQs and other documents addressing the various interpretive issues that have come up with regard to the exemption. See Notable Examples Illustrating the scope of the travel Exemption.  3) PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS  The Personal Communications exemption is common across programs, and interpretations of it can be found in the Research System by selecting the \"Key Legal Issues\" search criterion associated with the personal communications exemption. [12-23-23 UPDATE - See Case No. IA-2017-339679-1 (certain \"mentoring\" services provided by a non-profit over the internet through social media are exempt under the IEEPA \"personal communications\" exemption)].   4) DONATIONS/HUMANITARIAN  Some \"Exempt transactions\" provisions allow for transactions of this type. In this case, the President invoked the authority, granted under IEEPA, to decline to apply the exemption for donations.  5) TRANSACTIONS ORDINARILY INCIDENT TO EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS, GENERALLY  To the degree that a transaction is exempt from regulation as a result of an IEEPA-mandated exemption (i.e. personal communications, informational materials, travel, (and sometimes donations)), all transactions incident to the exempt transactions are also, themselves, exempt.

Hein & Co., Inc. 1285 Main Street Buffalo, NY 14209  Dear [     ]  This responds to your letter dated March 22, 2012 (the \"Application\"), on behalf of William S. Hein & Co., Inc., to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). You request a specific license to provide access to HeinOnline, a subscription database of legal information, to educational institutions, specifically the University of Tehran, in Iran. According to your Application, you seek guidance on the applicability of OFAC sanctions with respect to the commercial sale of access to an informational database.  The Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the \"ITR\"), generally prohibit the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply of any goods, technology, or services, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITR, § 560.204. Additionally, the ITR generally prohibit U.S. persons, wherever located, from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; or goods, technology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITR, § 560.206(a). This prohibition includes but is not limited to purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing. ITR, § 560.206(b). The ITR define the term U.S. person to mean any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. ITR, § 560.314.  The prohibitions in § 560.204 of the ITR on exports to Iran do not apply to the exportation to any country of information and informational materials, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission. ITR, § 560.210(c). The term information and informational materials includes publications, films, posters, phonograph records, photographs, microfilms, microfiche, tapes, compact disks, CD ROMS, artworks, and news wire feeds. ITR, § 560.315(a)(1). However, section 560.210(c)(2) of the ITR provides that the information and informational materials exemption does not apply to transactions related to items not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services.  The activities you propose in your Application appear to fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption as defined in the ITR. ITR, § 560.210(c). Therefore, an OFAC license is not required to provide subscription access to a searchable database of legal documents. Please note that, to fall under the information and informational materials exemption, the content must be fully created and in existence at the time of the transmission and may not be created at the behest of an Iranian person.  If you have any additional questions, you may refer to the OFAC website at www.treasury.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.  Sincerely,  [SIGNATURE]  Andrea Gacki Assistant Director for Licensing Office of Foreign Assets Control  Oct 9, 2012 \n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) Guidance reaffirms validity of 030430-FACRL-IA-04 (Internet Access to Informational Materials). Commercial transactions related to web-based databases are exempt from the ITSR, even where they contain search functionality and presumably envisage the provision of services ancillary to the export of the information, e.g. the provision of login credentials for a website.  OFAC concludes that \"to fall under the information and informational materials exemption, the content must be fully created and in existence at the time of the transmission and may not be created at the behest of an Iranian person.\" (Emphasis added).   Compare e.g. Case No. IA-18313 and note the relationship between these two concepts, and that in Case No. IA-18313 OFAC uses the term (as it appears in the regulations) \"in existence at the time of the transaction.\"  \"Fully created and in existence at the date of the transaction[]\" derives from the regulations (560.210(c)(2)) while \"not created at the behest of any persons in Iran\" does not. OFAC apparently wants to clarify that if a material is created \"at the behest of any persons in Iran,\" it will be considered outside the scope of the exemption. This is, in effect, a restatement of the exclusion from the informational materials exemption that applies to the \"substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials\". If a transaction relates to materials created at the behest of a sanctioned person, it is, presumably on a per se basis, \"substantively altered or enhanced\" at the behest of a sanctioned person.    2) 560.210(c)(2) deals with the problem with the harshness of the \"fully created and in existence at the date of the transaction\" language found in the regulations by including an exception for \"prepaid subscriptions for widely circulated magazines and other periodical publications.\" It is obvious that the informational materials exemption would apply to, e.g. a subscription to the New York Times, even though the subscription fee is paid in advance of the creation of the materials at issue.  In this case, however, the \"transaction\" concerning (i.e. subscription to) access to the legal information database is not described by the \"prepaid subscriptions for widely circulated magazines and other periodical publications\" language found in the regulations. To deal with the fact that access to the database is clearly exempt, albeit not necessarily on the basis of the plain text of the regulations, OFAC adopts the \"time of the transmission\" standard to ensure that it does not exceed the scope of its authority under IEEPA. Accord Open Society Justice Initiative et al v. Trump et al (1:20-cv-08121) (SDNY 2020) - OFAC/USG Memo. in Opp. to Pl. Motion for P.I. (key question is whether the materials at issue are \"bespoke\" for the sanctioned person). In situations such as these, where a \"transaction\" (such as the payment of a license or subscription fee) pertains to informational materials that are neither fully created as of the time of the licensing transaction nor \"fully created\" at the time of that transaction, OFAC accepts that the informational materials exemption can apply if the materials at issue are \"fully created at the time of the transmission\" (which will usually necessarily be the case) and \"not created at the behest\" of a sanctioned person. See also Comcast Corporation, Correspondence with SEC Division of Corporation Finance (2017), Q1 2018 10-Q Filing (license fees for the distribution of broadcasts that are not made or altered at the behest of any sanctioned party, but also necessarily not fully created as of the time of the licensing agreement).  3) Compare Case No. IA-2013-303560-1, a sort of companion case to this one. Case No. IA-2013-303560-1 deals with a database that is comparatively commercial in nature, and confirms that the provision of user IDs and passwords to sanctioned persons is not \"technical support\" not otherwise covered by the exemption.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

  "answer": "Yes. According to [Case No. IA-2012-293259-1], transactions that provide access to a subscription database of legal information can be exempt under the informational materials exemption—provided specific conditions are met. In that case, OFAC explained that, for the exemption to apply, the content must be fully created and in existence at the time of transmission and must not be created or altered at the behest of a sanctioned person. This means that if a legally subscribed database (like HeinOnline) only transmits pre‐existing legal information, without making substantive or artistic alterations or enhancements at the request of the user, then the transaction falls within the exemption and does not require an OFAC license.\n\nAdditional guidance in [Case No. MUL-2012-298067-1] reinforces this position by clarifying that commercial provision of subscriptions and access to pre-existing legal content generally qualifies as exempt—so long as the informational materials exemption’s conditions (such as not involving information not fully created at the time of the transaction or not engaging in prohibited alterations) are observed.\n\nIn summary, if the transaction involving the subscription database of legal information meets these criteria, it is exempt under the informational materials exemption."
