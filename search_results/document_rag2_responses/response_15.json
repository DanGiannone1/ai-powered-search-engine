(a) Personal communications. The prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to any postal, telegraphic, telephonic, or other personal communication, which does not involve the transfer of anything of value. (b) Information or informational materials. (1) The importation from any country and the exportation to any country of information or informational materials as defined in § 545.305, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission, are exempt from the prohibitions of this part. (2) This section does not exempt from regulation or authorize transactions related to information and informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services. Such prohibited transactions include, but are not limited to, payment of advances for information and informational materials not yet created and completed (with the exception of prepaid subscriptions for widely-circulated magazines and other periodical publications); provision of services to market, produce or co-produce, create, or assist in the creation of information or informational materials; and, with respect to information or informational materials imported from persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 545.201 or from the territory of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban, payment of royalties with respect to income received for enhancements or alterations made by U.S. persons to such information or informational materials. (3) This section does not exempt or authorize transactions incident to the exportation of software subject to the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730-774, or to the exportation of goods, technology or software, or to the provision, sale, or leasing of capacity on telecommunications transmission facilities (such as satellite or terrestrial network connectivity) for use in the transmission of any data. The exportation of such items or services and the provision, sale, or leasing of such capacity or facilities to a person whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 545.201 are prohibited. (c) Travel. The prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, including exportation or importation of accompanied baggage for personal use, maintenance within any country including payment of living expenses and acquisition of goods or services for personal use, and arrangement or facilitation of such travel including nonscheduled air, sea, or land voyages. (d) Official Business. The prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to transactions for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government or the United Nations by employees thereof. (e) Journalistic Activity. The prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to transactions in the territory of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban for journalistic activity by persons regularly employed in such capacity by a news-gathering organization. (f) Humanitarian donations. The prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to donations by U.S. persons of articles, such as food, clothing, and medicine, intended to be used to relieve human suffering.\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) OFAC has explicitly recognized that IEEPA exemptions apply to the Crimea embargo [1], but there appears to be no direct statement that the travel exemption in particular applies.   To the degree that there is any doubt as to whether the travel exemption applies to the Crimea embargo in light of it being a region and not a \"country,\" [2] this provision is notable as an interpretation of the Berman Amendment travel exemption as being applicable to the Taliban (Afghanistan) Sanctions Regulations. The Taliban regulations were a region-specific, IEEPA-based sanctions program similar to the Crimea embargo in that most prohibitions only applied to a specific region controlled by a government the U.S. considered illegitimate.   That the travel exemption applies to Crimea is further evidenced by the State Department's treatment of travel to the region, cautioning against travel to the region for various safety-related reasons, but not suggesting that such travel is actually prohibited (except for U.S. government employees prohibited from travel to the region for reasons unrelated to the OFAC-administered embargo) [3]. Compare the analogous Cuba page [4]. Consider also OFAC FAQ # 504 - Cyber General License (No. 1A), (the Federal Security Service), confirming that the travel exemption applies to an IEEPA-based sanctions program for which the implementing regulations contain no explicit travel exemption and which do not target any particular geographical area at all, much less a \"country.\"  [1] See Ukraine General License Number 8 -Transactions Related to Telecommunications and Mail Authorized \"(All transactions of common carriers incident to the receipt or transmission of mail and packages between the United States and the Crimea region of Ukraine are authorized, provided that the importation or exportation of such mail and packages is exempt from the prohibitions of Executive Order 13685 of December 19, 2014, or is otherwise authorized pursuant to 31 CFR part 589.)\"  [2] Sec 1702(b)(4) of IEEPA removes the President’s authority to regulate \"any transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country.\"  [3] Crimea: There is an extensive Russian Federation military presence in the Crimean Peninsula. Follow the guidance in our Travel Advisory for Ukraine and defer all travel to Crimea. If you choose to travel there, you should be aware: U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to Crimea and are unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens there. You may only legally enter Crimea from mainland Ukraine. Entrance into Crimea by any other entry point other than from mainland Ukraine, such as air, sea, or the Kerch Strait Bridge is illegal. You will be denied entry into mainland Ukraine and banned from entering Ukraine for five years.  Time spent in Crimea will count against the 90-day visa-free period.

Refer to, e.g. Examples of the \"Substantive or Artistic Alteration or Enhancement\" and \"Fully Created and in Existence\" Standards, Notes Common to the \"Information or informational materials\" Definitional Provision, Notable Applications of the Definition of \"Information or Informational Materials\" and Examples of Transactions Exempt as Incident to Underlying Informational Materials Transactions.  3) TRAVEL   a) The scope of the exemption for travel and transactions ordinarily incident thereto been interpreted identically across programs. The Research System contains a multitude of guidance letters, interpretive rulings, FAQs and other documents addressing the various interpretive issues that have come up with regard to the exemption. See Notable Examples Illustrating the scope of the travel Exemption.  4) PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS  The Personal Communications exemption is common across programs, and interpretations of it can be found in the Research System by selecting the \"Key Legal Issues\" search criterion associated with the personal communications exemption. [12-23-23 UPDATE - See Case No. IA-2017-339679-1 (certain \"mentoring\" services provided by a non-profit over the internet through social media are exempt under the IEEPA \"personal communications\" exemption)].   5) DONATIONS/HUMANITARIAN  Some \"Exempt transactions\" provisions allow for transactions of this type. In this case, the President invoked the authority, granted under IEEPA, to decline to apply the exemption for donations.  6) TRANSACTIONS ORDINARILY INCIDENT TO EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS, GENERALLY  To the degree that a transaction is exempt from regulation as a result of an IEEPA-mandated exemption (i.e. personal communications, informational materials, travel, (and sometimes donations)), all transactions incident to the exempt transactions are also, themselves, exempt. See Notes Common to the 400-Level Interpretive Provisions Authorizing Transactions \"Ordinarily Incident\" to a Licensed Transaction; Transactions Incident to Others in General (System Ed. Note). This is true whether or not the underlying transaction involves a U.S. person. See General Note and Associated Matrix Pertaining to U.S. Person Engagement in Transactions Incident to Transactions by Foreign Persons (System Ed. Note).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Can an insurer offer global travel insurance and worldwide travel assistance without violating U.S. sanctions?   Yes, provided that the provision of global travel insurance and travel assistance relate to travel that is exempt or authorized. The authority granted to the President by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not include the authority to regulate or prohibit, directly or indirectly, transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country. See 50 U.S.C. §1702 (b)(4). OFAC sanctions programs issued pursuant to IEEPA generally do not prohibit transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, including the issuance and provision of travel-related insurance coverage related to exempt travel.  Although the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) does not exempt travel from the President’s authority, the TWEA-based Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) authorize travel in limited circumstances. Travel related services, including travel insurance coverage, may only be provided in Cuba pursuant to a valid general or specific OFAC license. For example, if the traveler is a U.S. person traveling to Cuba pursuant to a valid OFAC authorization, a U.S. insurer may issue travel insurance to the traveler without obtaining a separate authorization.  Similarly, U.S. persons may issue or provide coverage for global health, life, or travel insurance policies for individuals ordinarily resident in a country outside of Cuba who travel to or within Cuba, pursuant to the general license at 31 C.F.R. § 515.580 of the CACR, as well as service such policies and pay claims arising from events that occurred while the individual was traveling in, or to or from, Cuba. (For more information, see FAQ 774.)  Additionally, insurers should check OFAC's List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) and other sanctions lists to ensure that no prohibited services are rendered to persons or entities on those lists.  Date Updated: November 13, 2024  Date Released January 15, 2015  ---  104. Can an insurer offer global travel insurance and worldwide travel assistance without violating U.S. sanctions? The provision of all travel related services are authorized for all OFAC country sanctions programs (including Burma, Iran and Sudan) except Cuba. Travel related services may only be provided in Cuba pursuant to a valid general or specific OFAC license. If the traveler is a U.S. person traveling to Cuba pursuant to a valid OFAC license, travel insurance may be issued to the traveler by a U.S. insurer without a separate license. Similarly, the issuance or provision of coverage for global health, life, or travel insurance policies for individuals ordinarily resident in a country outside of Cuba who travel to or within Cuba is authorized by general license, as is the servicing of such policies and payment of claim arising from events that occurred while the individual was traveling in, or to or from, Cuba.

[01-15-2015]\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) OFAC acknowledges that the issue of travel insurance is ordinarily incident to travel (where travel is exempt).  2) While there are no Crimea embargo regulations to say so explicitly, OFAC's statement here presumably applies to the Crimea embargo as well, seeing as it was enacted under IEEPA and the source of the authorization for the issue of global travel insurance is that it is ordinarily incident to travel exempt from regulation under IEEPA. This FAQ was issued/last updated subsequent to the issue of EO 13685.  3) The North Korean sanctions regulations also exempt transactions \"ordinarily incident to travel\" even though travel to North Korea has been effectively barred through non-sanctions-based means (i.e. special passport requirements).  4) FAQ amended on 11-13-24 to specify that \"[t]he authority granted to the President by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not include the authority to regulate or prohibit, directly or indirectly, transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country,\" such that regulations and EOs need not make any specific reference to the travel exemption for it to apply. See generally General Note on the Applicability of IEEPA/TWEA Exemptions in EOs and Sanctions Regulations not Specifically Mentioning Them.   5) FAQ amended to specify that \"the issuance and provision of travel-related insurance coverage related to exempt travel,\" i.e. it is not only in the context of \"global travel insurance and worldwide travel assistance\" that such insurance is exempt from regulation. (See Notable Examples Illustrating the Scope of the Travel Exemption).    6) FAQ amended on 11-13-24 to clarify that the provision of travel insurance coverage related to authorized travel to Cuba is a \"travel-related service\" (for purposes of 515.572 of the CACR).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Cuban nationals who have taken up residence in the United States and are licensed as unblocked nationals pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 515.505(a)(1) are persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction and may be transported between the United States and Cuba if they meet the criteria set out in the first bullet above. •  An individual, including a foreign national, who is traveling on official business of the U.S. government, a foreign government, or an intergovernmental organization of which the United States is a member or in which the United States holds observer status – including an employee, contractor, or grantee of such government or intergovernmental organization and any individual traveling on a diplomatic passport, as well as any close relative, as defined in 31 C.F.R. § 515.339, accompanying the traveler — may be transported between the United States and Cuba.  Section 515.572 of the CACR authorizes persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction to provide carrier services to, from, or within Cuba, in connection with travel and transportation of individuals between the United States and Cuba, directly or indirectly, authorized pursuant to the CACR. The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regulates the temporary sojourn to Cuba of both aircraft and vessels, which in some cases is authorized by License Exception Aircraft, Vessels and Spacecraft (AVS) but may require separate authorization by BIS. Persons engaging in carrier services may require additional authorizations by other U.S. government agencies. Persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction providing travel or carrier services are required to retain for at least five years from the date of the transaction a certification from each customer indicating the section of the CACR, or a copy of the specific license or the specific license number, that authorizes the person to travel to Cuba. Certifications may be collected and maintained in any form, including electronically, and must be retained for at least five years from the date of the transaction.   What type of cargo may a person authorized to provide carrier services transport from the United States to Cuba?  Section 515.533 of the CACR authorizes all transactions ordinarily incident to the export to Cuba of items licensed or otherwise authorized by BIS. Accordingly, a person providing carrier services for authorized travelers going from the United States to Cuba may transport cargo and baggage accompanying an authorized traveler provided that the export of the cargo and baggage is authorized by BIS. Additionally, a person providing carrier services for authorized travelers going from the United States to Cuba may transport other cargo or unaccompanied baggage whose export to Cuba is authorized by BIS.  The exportation of information and informational materials, as defined in section 515.332 of the CACR, to Cuba from the United States is exempt from the prohibitions of the CACR.  What type of cargo may a person authorized to provide carrier services transport from Cuba to the United States?  Under the CACR, an authorized traveler departing Cuba for the United States may carry as accompanied baggage:  •  For persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, any Cuban-origin items for personal use only, including Cuban-origin alcohol and tobacco products, as authorized by 31 CFR § 515.560(c)(3). •  For foreign nationals, any Cuban-origin items, including alcohol and tobacco products, provided that such goods are not in commercial quantities and are not imported for resale, as authorized by 31 CFR § 515.569. •  All travelers also may carry goods produced by Cuban entrepreneurs as authorized by 31 CFR § 515.582 and the State Department’s Section 515.582 List (available at http://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/cuba/515582/237471.htm). •  A traveler who left the United States for Cuba and is now returning to the United States also may carry any items the traveler temporarily exported to Cuba pursuant to a BIS authorization.  Additionally, persons authorized to provide carrier services may transport from Cuba to the United States cargo, other than accompanied baggage, the importation of which has been authorized by general or specific license from OFAC, subject to obtaining any additional authorization(s) that may be required by any other relevant U.S. government agency.  The importation of Cuban-origin information and informational materials, as defined in section 515.332 of the CACR, is exempt from the prohibitions of the CACR.  Imports authorized by OFAC would still be subject to other U.S. laws, such as import duties.  [1] This includes individuals eligible to enter the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), as administered through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA).\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) This guidance appears to make clear that, with respect to the provision of carrier services from Cuba to the U.S. within the scope of 515.572(a)(2), the only individuals that may be transported are i) persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction who are traveling to or from Cuba pursuant to a general license under one of the 12 categories, ii) certain Cuban nationals, and iii) certain foreign nationals travelling in connection with official governmental and intergovernmental organizational travel.   These limitations are crafted so as to exclude the majority of persons that are i) not subject to U.S. jurisdiction, but ii) whose travel falls within the scope of one or more of the CACR’s travel-related 12 general licenses. See General Note on the Provision of Services Related to Travel by non-U.S. Persons to Cuba (System Ed. Note). discussing the issue in further detail.   2) The rest of the guidance generally restates the provisions of the CACR referenced.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

May an individual authorized traveler take a commercial passenger ferry or use his or her private boat to travel to Cuba?  The export or reexport to Cuba of items subject to the EAR, including commercial vessels used to provide carrier services and private vessels, requires separate authorization from the Department of Commerce. See 31 CFR § 515.533. For a complete description of BIS’s regulatory requirements, see BIS’s Cuba webpage.  While 31 CFR § 515.572 generally authorizes the provision of carrier services, OFAC amended its regulations effective June 5, 2019 to highlight the separate BIS requirements. For a complete description of what the OFAC general license authorizes and the restrictions that apply, see 31 CFR § 515.572. [09-06-2019]\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) But note that, to the degree that the export of the vehicle is not subject to the EAR, e.g. as a result of the export being neither from the U.S. nor of an item of U.S. origin, there is no reason that a U.S. person travelling to Cuba pursuant to a remaining GL could not use that mode of transportation to reach Cuba.   2) The FAQ prior to the amendment of the BIS rule concerning exports of ferries and aircrafts provided as follows:  27. May I take a commercial passenger ferry to travel to Cuba?  Yes, provided that you are authorized to travel to Cuba pursuant to a general or specific license. Persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction are authorized to provide carrier services by vessel to authorized travelers, and travelers may purchase tickets provided that their travel is authorized pursuant to the CACR. The authorization to provide carrier services is limited to transportation of authorized travelers, directly or indirectly, between the United States and Cuba. Vessel operators and travelers are responsible for maintaining records of their Cuba-related transactions for at least five years. For a complete description of what this general license authorizes and the restrictions that apply, see 31 CFR § 515.572.  3) BIS explained its 5/6/2019 Cuba changes as follows:  On June 5, 2019, the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the Department of State will take coordinated actions to support the President’s policy to restrict non-family travel to Cuba in order to hold the Cuban regime accountable for its repression of the Cuban people and its support of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.  BIS will amend License Exception Aircraft, Vessels, and Spacecraft (AVS) to remove the authorization for the export or reexport to Cuba of most non-commercial aircraft and all passenger and recreational vessels on temporary sojourn.  BIS also will amend the licensing policy for exports and reexports to Cuba of aircraft and vessels on temporary sojourn to establish a general policy of denial.    Consequently, private and corporate aircraft, cruise ships, sailboats, fishing boats, and other similar aircraft and vessels generally will be prohibited from going to Cuba.   The United States maintains a comprehensive embargo on trade with Cuba.  The export and reexport to Cuba of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) require a BIS license unless authorized by a license exception specified in section 746.2(a)(1) of the EAR or exempted from license requirements in section 746.2(a)(2).  The EAR sets forth licensing policy for exports and reexports that generally will be approved, exports and reexports that will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and exports and reexports that will generally be denied.  For additional information, please review the BIS rule, Department press release, and BIS’s updated Frequently Asked Questions.  For specific questions regarding exports or reexports to Cuba, please contact the Foreign Policy Division at (202) 482-4252.   If a cruise ship, recreational vessel, or non-commercial aircraft departed the United States before June 5, 2019, is it allowed to arrive in Cuba on or after June 5, 2019? (NEW)  No. Effective June 5, 2019, a license from the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is required for a cruise ship, recreational vessel, or non-commercial aircraft to go to Cuba, directly or indirectly. License applications for the temporary sojourn to Cuba of those vessels and aircraft are subject to a general policy of denial.  Do the Bureau of Industry and Security’s (BIS) changes restricting the temporary sojourn of aircraft or vessels to Cuba include a \"grandfathering\" provision? (NEW)  No.  Effective June 5, 2019, a license from BIS is required for a cruise ship, recreational vessel, or non-commercial aircraft to go to Cuba, directly or indirectly.  License applications for the temporary sojourn to Cuba of those vessels and aircraft are subject to a general policy of denial.

Iran: Travel Exemption\n=== END TITLE ===\n\n=== DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n031125-FACRL-IA-12 November 25, 2003  IRAN: TRAVEL EXEMPTION FAC No. [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  Dear [text deleted]:    This is with regard to your letters of January 9, 2003, June 6, 2003, and June 12, 2003 to the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") on behalf of [a U.S. person]. In your letters you inquired whether the travel exemption provisions contained in § 560.210(d) of the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the \"Regulations\"), authorize [U.S. persons] to engage in the following activities involving the arrangement of air travel between the United States and Iran:  1)  Publication of schedules of flights between Europe and Iran; 2)  Publication of interline airfares; 3)  Acceptance of reservations for travel between the United States and Iran; 4)  Issuance of airline tickets for the entire trip between the United States and Iran; and 5)  Advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran.  Section 560.204 of the Regulations prohibits the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, technology, or services to Iran or the Government of Iran. However, § 560.210(c) of the Regulations provides that the prohibitions do not apply to the importation from and the exportation to any country of information and informational materials fully created and in existence at the time of the transaction.In addition, § 560.210(d) of the Regulations provides that the prohibitions contained in § 560.204 do not apply to transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, including importation of accompanied baggage for personal use, maintenance within any country including payment of living expenses and acquisition of goods or services for personal use, and arrangement or facilitation of such travel including nonscheduled air, sea, or land voyages. Section 560.210(d) of the Regulations further provides that the exemption extends to transactions with Iranian carriers and those involving group tours and payments in Iran made for transactions directly incident to travel.   Based upon the information submitted, we have concluded that, with the exceptions noted below, the exemptions set forth in § 560.210 (c and d) of the Regulations are applicable to all of the above listed activities involving airline travel between the United States and Iran.  With respect to the advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran, the Regulations do not prohibit such transactions unless they are undertaken at the behest of a person in Iran or an Iranian entity. The Regulations would prohibit advertising-related transactions undertaken at the behest of a person or entity in Iran, unless the information or informational materials exemption applies. To fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption, such transactions must be limited to the direct dissemination of copy-ready materials. A U.S. person cannot provide any other related services to Iran, such as the development of advertising materials or an advertising campaign or serving as an agent for the buying or brokering of advertising space, without OFAC authorization. Such activities do not fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption. Such activities also would not fall within the scope of the travel exemption, as they are not directly incident to travel.  Although the travel exemption set forth in § 560.210(d) of the Regulations applies regardless of whether the connecting carrier is Iran Air or another Iranian air carrier, it applies only to arranging travel and should not be construed to authorize transactions not directly incident to travel, such as the creation or enhancement of a travel reservation service in Iran. Further, while [U.S. persons] are authorized to accept reservations, issue tickets for travel on Iranian carriers, and advertise air service between the United States and Iran (subject to the caveats referenced above), any U.S. origin financial services used to exchange payments with Iran must fall within the scope of the authorizations set forth in § 560.516 of the Regulations, which necessitate the use of non-U.S., non-Iranian financial institutions as intermediaries to such transactions.  If you have any additional questions about the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, you may refer to our web site at www.treas.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.   Sincerely,   [Signature]  R. Richard Newcomb Director Office of Foreign Assets Control    \n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) The Guidance analyzes a set of transactions at the intersection of the Berman Amendment exemptions for travel and transactions ordinarily incident thereto (560.210(d)) and the exemption for informational materials transactions (560.210(c)).   With regard to OFAC's declaration that \"the Regulations do not prohibit [the advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran] unless they are undertaken at the behest of a person in Iran or an Iranian entity,\" compare FAC No. CU-156123, considering a Cuban travel company paying a U.S. person to broadcast advertising as being within the scope of informational materials exemption (i.e. where the travel exemption was not available). The reason why the advertising generally is not permitted is because OFAC deems it i) not ordinarily incident to travel, and ii) more of a service than a transaction incident to the import/export of informational materials, but when the advertising transaction only involves the dissemination of pre-existing materials, it is exempt. [1] As confirmed by FAC No. CU-156123, \"copy ready\" does not imply that qualifying materials cannot be in audio/visual format.   2) Other guidance clarifies OFAC's positions on the publication of fares and acceptance of reservations (FACRL-CU-01 2002), acting as a travel agent (Case No. IA-17270) and dealing with an entity designated pursuant to a sanctions program with a travel exemption (Case No. IA-16194). See also our discussion on SEC filings describing activities done by companies purporting to act under the Berman Amendment exemptions for travel.   Compare Case No. IA-17270 with the statement that \"the creation or enhancement of a travel reservation service in Iran\" is prohibited.  Case No. IA-17270, issued 10 years after the publication of this guidance, seems to stand for the proposition that doing more than simply accepting reservations is exempt, at least in connection with Iranians traveling to the U.S.  3) Guidance should apply generally to all IEEPA-based programs with a travel exemption. With respect to Cuba, a combination of the informational materials exemption of the CACR combined with current general licenses related to travel will have much the same result, but not in all cases.    4) See Delta Air Lines, Inc., Correspondence with the SEC Office of Global Security Risk (2007): sale of tickets pursuant to codeshare agreements considered exempt when the tickets involve travel to sanctioned destinations other than Cuba.  [1] Refer to section 2(I) of the \"Ordinarily Incident\" System Note; comment to Case No. IA-2012-299245-1.  5) See Iran-Related Civil Aviation Industry Advisory (2019), and comments thereto, concerning the relationship between primary and secondary sanctions in the aviation industry.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

  "answer": "No. According to the exemption language set forth in several of these documents – for example, [31 CFR § 545.208] and [31 CFR § 536.205] – the travel exemption applies only to transactions \"ordinarily incident to travel.\" That phrase is defined to include items such as the export or importation of accompanied baggage for personal use, payment of living expenses, and arrangements or facilitation of travel. In contrast, arrangements or transactions related to cargo freight – including any compartments or facilities used solely for the transport of commercial cargo – are not covered by this exemption. \n\nIn other words, because cargo freight shipments (or “parts” thereof) do not fall into the category of matters incident to personal travel, they do not benefit from the travel exemption provided under these regulations. None of the documents indicate that any commercial cargo freight or compartments used for it are treated as “accompanied baggage” or otherwise incident to travel for personal use.\n\nThe commentary accompanying these provisions further reinforces that the travel exemption is intended solely for travel-related transactions (whether for accompanied baggage or for travel arrangements), not for the exportation of goods or commercial freight services."
