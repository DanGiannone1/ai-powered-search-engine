You asked how the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R Part 515 (the \"Regulations\"), would apply to a transaction, pursuant to which the radio station would broadcast an advertisement for Havanatur, a Cuban national. Based on the representations in your letter, the proposed transaction is not subject to the prohibition contained in the Regulations.   You represent that Havanatur or its non-U.S. affiliate would prepare a radio advertisement and provide the prepared advertisement to the U.S. radio station in the form of an audiotape. You represent that Havanatur would pay the station to play the advertisement. You imply that the station would perform no services for Havanatur other than broadcasting the audiotape exactly as the tape was provided to it by Havanatur, i.e., that in the proposed transaction no U.S. person or entity would alter or enhance the tape or perform any other services for Havanatur.  Section 5(b)(4) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 App. U.S.C. §§ 1-44 (\"TWEA\"), states that the President does not have authority to \"regulate or prohibit, directly or indirectly, the importation from any country, or the exportation to any country, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission, of any information or informational materials, including but not limited to... tapes... \"  A commercial audiotape is among the types of information specifically exempted from regulation by TWEA. Under the Regulations, to be included within the exemption, the audiotape must be fully created and in existence at the date of the transaction, and the transaction must not involve altering or enhancing the tape or providing marketing and business consulting services. If, as you represent and imply, the proposed transaction includes the provision of no services other than playing on the radio an audiotape of a commercial, the transaction would be exempt from regulation under § 5(b)(4), and therefore would not require a license.  Sincerely,   [Signature]  R. Richard Newcomb Director  Office of Foreign Assets Control  Michael Krinsky, Esq. Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky & Lieberman, P.c. 740 Broadway at Astor Place New York, New York 10003-9518\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) OFAC considers the broadcasting of an advertisement to fall within the scope of the informational materials exemption of the Berman Amendment. This ruling is notable as it is a commercial transaction where (presumably) fully 100% of the payment to the U.S. person was in consideration of an assumption of an obligation to broadcast the sanctioned person's message, (rather than the right to do so, as in ordinary cases of licensing the use of \"informational materials\"). In other words, the \"service\" that was considered exempt as incident to the exportation of the informational materials was the heart of the entire transaction, and the export of the exempt \"materials\" was the tail that wagged the \"service\" dog. Compare 031211-FACRL-IA-14. Posting of Information from Iran on Website.  The guidance is also notable insofar as the injunction against providing \"marketing services\" embedded with the boilerplate \"exempt transaction\" provision implementing the Berman Amendment does not apply where, as here, the entire exempt transaction itself can be considered a \"marketing service.\" In this context, the dissemination of the advertisement itself could be characterized as a sort of \"marketing\" service.  The version of the CACR interpreted in the letter contained an informational materials provision (515.206(b)) that, as is the case with current versions of the provision, specified that \"[t]his section does not authorize transactions related to information or informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transaction, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of information or informational materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services by a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-1997-title31-vol2/xml/CFR-1997-title31-vol2-part515.xml#seqnum515.206).  3) That OFAC cites the Berman Amendment in TWEA directly as the source of its decision implies applicability to the analogous phrasing of the IEEPA version of the Berman Amendment. Compare 031125-FACRL-IA-12 November 25, 2003 (Iran, Travel Exemption).  4) 515.545 has been broadened significantly since this guidance was issued, but the guidance remains helpful as it relates to the scope of the informational materials exemption as a general matter. The guidance is old, but there appears to be nothing in direct conflict with it.   5) Compare LinkedIn Corporation, Correspondence with SEC Division of Corporation Finance (2013), re: 2012 10-K Filing; 2015 10-K Filing, where LinkedIn/Microsoft appear to take a view similar to the one expressed here in connection with publishing solicitations for job applicants by a Syrian SDN company.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Box 5085 Austin, TX 78763 Dear [      ]  This is in response to your correspondence dated June 8, 2013 (the \"Application\"), to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). Specifically, you are requesting guidance on whether it is permissible for you, a U.S. citizen and licensed attorney, to provide legal advice in Iran to Iranian citizens and U.S. persons in Iran on the topic of United States immigration law and be compensated for your work. You would also like to place an advertisement in the Iranian Lawyer’s Association publication advertising your services to assist with issues in U.S. immigration law.   The Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the \"ITSR\"), generally prohibit the importation into the United States of any goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.201. The ITSR also generally prohibit the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply of any goods, technology, or services, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.204. Additionally, the ITSR generally prohibit U.S. persons, wherever located, from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; or goods, technology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.206(a). This prohibition includes but is not limited to purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing. ITSR, § 560.206(b). The ITSR define the term U.S. person to mean any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. ITSR, § 560.314.   Please be further advised that the ITSR do not authorize transactions that would be prohibited by different sanctions program administered by OFAC, such as current restrictions under the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 544) (\"WMDPSR\") or the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 594) (\"GTSR\"), pursuant to which certain banks are designated, including but not limited to Ansar Bank, Bank of Industry and Mine, Bank Mellat, Bank Melli, Bank Refah, Bank Saderat, Bank Sepah, Bank Tejarat, Europaisch-Iranische Handelsbank, Export Development Bank of Iran, Future Bank B.S.C., Kargoshaee Bank, Mehr Bank, or Post Bank of Iran (\"designated banks\"). See ITSR, § 560.101; see also 31 C.F.R. §§ 544.201 and 594.201.   Section 560.525 of the ITSR generally authorizes provision of legal advice and counseling on the requirements of and compliance with the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States to or on behalf of the Government of Iran, an Iranian financial institution, or any other person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 560.211 of the ITSR, or to or on behalf of a person in Iran, or in circumstances in which the benefit is otherwise received in Iran is authorized, provided that such advice and counseling is not provided to facilitate transactions in violation of the ITSR, and further provided that receipt of payment of professional fees and reimbursement of incurred expenses are authorized by or pursuant to paragraph (d) of section 560.525 of the ITSR or otherwise authorized pursuant to the ITSR. ITSR, § 560.525(a)(1); see ITSR, § 560.553.   From the information provided in the Application, to the extent that you provide legal advice in Iran to Iranian citizens and U.S. persons in Iran on the topic of United States immigration law and receive compensation for your work, such transactions appear to qualify for the general license under section 560.525(a)(1) of the ITSR. Please see sections 560.525(d) and 560.553 for provisions on compensation for such services. Any services beyond those described in section 560.525, however, may require a specific license from OFAC. Please note further that the general license in section 560.525 of the ITSR would not authorize activities such as establishing a legal office in Iran.   Further, the prohibitions contained in the ITSR do not apply to the importation from any country and the exportation to any country of information and informational materials as defined in section 560.315, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission. ITSR, § 560.210(c). This section does not exempt transactions related to information or informational materials not fully created and in existence at the time of the transactions, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services. Further, section 560.210(c) does not exempt payment of advances for information and informational materials not yet created and completed (with the exception of prepaid subscriptions for widely circulated periodical publications), and provision of services to market, produce or co-produce, create, or assist in the creation of information and informational materials.  Pursuant to the ITSR, the exportation of preexisting advertising materials to Iran would not be prohibited, provided that they are not created at the behest of persons in Iran. Therefore, your law firm may export pre-existing, copy-ready advertising materials for its legal services to be included in the Iranian Lawyer’s Association.   If you have any additional questions, you may refer to the OFAC website at www.treasury.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.  Sincerely,  [Signature] Oct 21, 2013  Andrea Gacki Assistant Director for Licensing  Office of Foreign Assets Control \n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) Immigration law advice falls within the scope of 560.525, the legal services general license that appears in almost all sanctions regulations. Note however that certain immigration law-related services carried out by attorneys can be considered \"financial services\" not within the scope of 560.525 and its equivalents. [See Case No. IA-2012-(Chicagoland Foreign Investment Group, LLC)].  2) OFAC clarifies that establishing a legal office in Iran is not \"ordinarily incident\" to the provision of legal services to clients in Iran, but also that providing such services while \"in Iran\" is within the scope of the GL. That this is permitted is not at all obvious from the GL, which provides that the advice may be provided \"to or on behalf of a person in Iran,\" but says nothing about whether a U.S. person can provide the U.S.-related legal advice in Iran.  Query whether OFAC's conclusion on this issue is the product of an interpretation of 560.405 (transactions ordinarily incident to those licensed, here 560.525), or whether OFAC looks at the travel to Iran as exempt by 560.210(d), and once in Iran through the exemption there is nothing preventing the advice from being given within the authorization of 560.525.   Either way the conclusion is significant, because it either means that travel for commercial purposes can be covered by 560.210(d), or that travel to Iran for the purposes transacting in a way envisaged by general licenses is within the scope of those GLs even when there is nothing in the GL specifically contemplating being on the ground in Iran. Given OFAC's longstanding position that travel to Cuba in connection with certain exempt informational materials transactions is not exempt as incident to the exportation of the materials themselves (thereby necessitating §515.545(b)(2)), it might appear that the basis for the guidance here is the combination of the legal services GL and the travel exemption, rather than a determination that travel to Iran is \"ordinarily incident\" to the provision of the legal advice itself. But see Case No. IQ-2655 and all associated specific licenses (travel to Iraq as ordinarily incident to underlying contract execution-related transactions authorized).   4) Given the context of the guidance and request, it seems clear that the publication referred to is one in Iran. In 031125-FACRL-IA-12, OFAC considered advertisements relating to travel (presumably placed in Iran) to fall within the scope of the informational materials exemption, subject to the usual caveats.  Here, OFAC allows that advertising generally falls within the informational materials exemption, provided that the materials of which the advertisements are comprised are not made at the behest of a sanctioned party. Implied here is that the attorney may \"import services\" from the publication in connection with the placement of the ads; a transaction that would ordinarily be prohibited by 560.201 but in this case is exempt as incident to the export of the exempt advertising materials. (Refer to section 2(I) of the \"Ordinarily Incident\" System Note and e.g. Case No. IA-2012-299245-1). Compare FAC No. CU-156123, involving dissemination of pre-existing advertising materials but where the sanctioned party is the one advertising and the U.S. person is the one doing the dissemination. See also Case No. IA-2015-xxxxxx-1 (12 Sept 2015) for a similar situation but dealing with advertising through the internet.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Inc. 7600 Boston Boulevard, Suite 100 Springfield, VA 22153   Dear Ms. [     ]:   This responds to your August 22, 2008 letter to the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"'OFAC\") on behalf of Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Inc. (\"MBN\"), a U.S. person. According to your letter, MBN provides news and information to Arabic-speaking populations in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe and receives 100% of its funding from grants administered by the Broadcasting Board of Governors. MBN is requesting a license to transfer funds to pay free-lance reporters and writers to provide content for new programming for Sudan and, in particular, for Darfur.   The Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 538 (the \"SSR\") prohibit the exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, to Sudan of any goods, technology or services from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, or requiring the issuance- of a license by a Federal agency. SSR, § 538.205. Please be advised that transactions in Sudan for journalistic activity by persons regularly employed in such capacity by news gathering organizations are not prohibited. SSR, § 538.212(f). Also, section 538.531 of the SSR authorizes all transactions and activities that are for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government by contractors or grantees thereof. Contractors or grantees so authorized must provide a copy of their contract or grant with the U.S. Government to any U.S. person before the U.S. person engages in or facilitates any transaction or activity otherwise prohibited.  The contractors and grantees must keep a full and accurate record of each transaction, including a. copy of the contract or grant, available for examination for at least five years after the date of the transaction. No payment may involve a debit to a blocked account or be to anyone designated.  In addition, the authorized transfers of funds must be effected in a manner consistent with the SSR, and may not be paid to a bank owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan.   In conclusion, no license is necessary when the underlying activities are either not prohibited or authorized. If you have any questions about OFAC or about the economic sanctions administered by OFAC against Sudan, you may refer to our website at www.treas.gov/ofac, or call this office at (202) 622- 2480.   Sincerely,   Jodi L. Kouts   [6/16/09]   Assistant Director for Licensing Office of Foreign Assets Control\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1)   This guidance letter adds to the corpus of notable \"official business\"-related guidance letters described in General Note on Exemptions and General Licenses for the \"Official Business\" of the U.S. Government (and/or United Nations) and Employees, Contractors, or Grantees Thereof. Here, we have a \"corporation\" (MBN), which OFAC appears to regard as not qualifying as the \"United States Government\" notwithstanding that it \"receives 100% of its funding from grants administered by the Broadcasting Board of Governors\" (the BBG was a U.S. government agency. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Agency_for_Global_Media).  However, the fact that MBN \"receives 100% of its funding from grants administered by\" a government agency appears to lead OFAC to conclude that, on a per se basis, i.e. without the need to examine the connection between the grant and activities at issue, the otherwise prohibited activities of MBN would qualify as \"the conduct of the official business of the United States Government by…grantees thereof…\" Compare Case No. SY-2019-364717-1 (similar but \"contractor\").   2)  Section 538.212(f) of the SSR as they existed at the relevant time provided that the SSR’s prohibitions \"do not apply to transactions in Sudan for journalistic activity by persons regularly employed in such capacity by a news-gathering organization.\" OFAC appears willing to accept that a U.S.-based news-gathering organization hiring a freelancer in Sudan qualifies as a \"transactions in Sudan for journalistic activity by persons regularly employed in such capacity by a news-gathering organization\". Here, the freelancer may not be \"regularly employed\" by the news-gathering organization, but individuals working for MBN would be involved in the hiring, and this would be regarded as a transaction \"in Sudan\".  3)  See 538.531 of the SSR as they existed at the relevant time https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2009-title31-vol3/xml/CFR-2009-title31-vol3-part538.xml), and query why OFAC says \"the authorized transfers of funds must be effected in a manner consistent with the SSR, and may not be paid to a bank owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan.\" The \"official business\" GL is clear that \"No payment pursuant to this section may involve a debit to an account blocked pursuant to this part,\" which is common, but what prevents an otherwise authorized payment from being paid into a \"bank owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan\"?   538.405 of the SSR, which was the standard \"ordinarily incident\" provision with certain additional clawbacks, stated that \"[a]ny transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction and necessary to give effect thereto is also authorized, except…[a] transaction by an unlicensed Sudanese governmental entity or involving a debit to a blocked account or a transfer of blocked property not explicitly authorized within the terms of the license\". Payments into banks owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan would constitute a \"transaction by an unlicensed Sudanese governmental entity\".\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

If I want to engage in a transaction or activity prohibited by OFAC, how can I do so? Can I rely on a general or specific license to engage in a transaction involving a sanctioned jurisdiction or person?  OFAC issues general licenses to authorize certain transactions that would otherwise be prohibited pursuant to a particular sanctions program. These general licenses are self-executing, meaning they allow persons to engage in certain transactions involving the United States or U.S. persons without needing to apply for a specific license, provided the transactions meet certain terms and conditions as described in the general license. In addition, some categories of activities, such as personal communications and transactions ordinarily incident to travel, may be exempt from sanctions in certain programs. Subject to sanctions program-specific considerations, non-U.S. persons do not generally risk being sanctioned for engaging in or facilitating transactions for which a U.S. person would not require a specific license.  If you seek to engage in a prohibited transaction involving a U.S. person or blocked property and there is no applicable general license or exemption, you may apply for a specific license from OFAC by submitting a license application. OFAC may grant, on a case-by-case basis, a specific license to authorize a person to engage in a transaction, or series of transactions, that otherwise would be prohibited by sanctions. For guidance on how to request and apply for a specific license, please see 31 CFR § 501.801 and the License Application page on OFAC’s website.  Date Updated: August 21, 2024.  Updated on Aug 21, 2024    --  7. Can I get permission from OFAC to transact or trade with an embargoed country? OFAC usually has the authority by means of a specific license to permit a person or entity to engage in a transaction which otherwise would be prohibited. In some cases, however, legislation may restrict that authority.  To apply for a specific license, please go to our License Application Page.   [Ed Note: see original FAQ for hyperlinks]\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1)  FAQ amended on 8-21-24 concurrent with Modernizing Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (Press Release), detailing several modernization efforts, including the updating of a number of general interest FAQs containing dated language.   This FAQ was amended to, among other less notable statements, offer assurances that \"[s]ubject to sanctions program-specific considerations, non-U.S. persons do not generally risk being sanctioned for engaging in or facilitating transactions for which a U.S. person would not require a specific license.\" This is an extremely consequential statement, and it appears to come out of nowhere in the broader context of an FAQ otherwise dealing with primary sanctions only (see comment 4 to Jul 3/Jun 5, 2024 Informal West Bank-Related Guidance [Application included], and Comments on Related Litigation, raising the possibility that this was inserted into the FAQ for eventual litigation purposes).   2)  Refer generally to General Note on \"Counterfactual Secondary Sanctions and Derivative Designation Safe Harbors\" in Certain OFAC Guidance and FAQs (System Ed. Note). OFAC has issued many statements worded similar to the statement quoted above, but this is the first time OFAC has done so in a (nearly) across-the-board, cross-programmatic fashion.   3)  As it relates to the (nearly), query what OFAC means by \"[s]ubject to sanctions program-specific considerations\". Does this mean that, unless OFAC has issued guidance deviating from the \"for which a U.S. person would not require a specific license\" general principle, the general principle applies and can be relied on without seeking confirmation from OFAC concerning its secondary sanctions enforcement policy? This would appear to apply at least in the context of blocking prohibitions, where all transactions involving blocked persons are prohibited in principle for U.S. persons, and possibly in all other cases except where OFAC has issued guidance to the contrary, but this is still unclear.   4)  The most notable example of OFAC doing so is in the Russia-related secondary sanctions and targeting context (see Updated Guidance for Foreign Financial Institutions on OFAC Sanctions Authorities Targeting Support to Russia’s Military-Industrial Base), where it is suggested (but not stated explicitly) that there is a broad range of sanctionable conduct for which U.S. persons would not require a specific license (i.e. because the conduct is outside the scope of OFAC’s prohibitions). More specifically, OFAC says that \"[f]oreign persons do not risk the imposition of sanctions for engaging in transactions authorized for U.S. persons under general licenses\" (e.g. \"Updated Guidance for Foreign Financial Institutions\"), that statement serves as notice that the safe harbor is narrower than it would be otherwise if FAQ # 7 applied, because there many sanctionable types of transactions in the Russia context, in particular those based on the designation criteria for \"operating in\" specified Russian sectors, where non-U.S. persons are sanctioned for conduct that would not qualify for a general license if engaged in by a U.S. person, but are also not necessarily transactions for which a U.S. person would require a specific license (i.e. because there are no broad prohibitions against \"operating in\" any given sector of the Russian economy).    \n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

What do I do if a person tries to open an account and the individual or entity’s name is on OFAC’s SDN List (or is otherwise a blocked person)?  Do I open the account and then block the funds?  A U.S. financial institution, its foreign branches, and — in some cases — its wholly-owned or -controlled foreign subsidiaries, cannot open an account for a person named on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) or a person who is otherwise blocked (e.g., a blocked government or an entity that is subject to the 50 Percent Rule​).  This is a prohibited service.  However, the institution or its affiliates should pay careful attention to ensure the person trying to open the account is the same person as the one named on OFAC’s SDN List or is otherwise subject to blocking.  In many cases, an institution may identify a \"false positive,\" where the name is similar to a sanctioned person’s name, but the rest of the information provided by the applicant does not match the descriptor information on OFAC’s SDN List.  If a U.S. financial institution does come into the possession or control of any property in which a blocked person has an interest, the U.S. financial institution is obligated to block that property.  In other words, if you receive an application to open an account from a person who matches the information on the SDN List, together with an opening deposit, you are obligated to block the funds.  The same is true for other banking transactions.  If, for example, a customer asks if he or she is allowed to send money to a relative’s account with Bank of XYZ, which appears on the SDN List, the bank can say \"no, that’s illegal.\"  If, on the other hand, a bank receives instructions from its customer to debit his or her account and send the funds to Bank of XYZ, the bank must act on the instructions by blocking the funds that contain a future interest of the SDN bank.  You might think of the analogy of a bouncing ball.  Once the ball starts moving, you must stop it if it comes into your possession.

See Case No. FNK-2016-333921-1 [Documents related to subsequent legal challenge in original PDF], and comments thereto, where litigation involved the blocking of funds arguably without concrete instructions to send them to a blocked person.  2) FAQ amended on Aug. 11, 2020 \"to reflect that Sudan has not been a comprehensively sanctioned country since October 12, 2017\" (see https://web.archive.org/web/20221207223105/https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20200811).  The original FAQ read as follows:  42. What do I do if a person tries to open an account and the person's name is on OFAC's SDN list? Do I open the account and then block the funds? A U.S. bank cannot open an account for a person named on the SDN list. This is a prohibited service. However, you should pay careful attention to be sure the person trying to open the account is the same person as the one named on OFAC's list. In many cases you may get a \"false positive,\" where the name is similar to a target's name, but the rest of the information provided by the applicant does not match the descriptor information on OFAC's SDN list. If the bank does come into the possession or control of any property in which a blocked person has an interest, it is obligated to block that property. In other words, if you receive an application to open an account from a person who matches the information on the SDN list, together with an opening deposit, you are obligated to block the funds. The same is true for other banking transactions. If, for example, a customer asks if he or she is allowed to send money to a relative's account with Bank of XYZ in Sudan, the bank can say \"no, that's illegal.\" If, on the other hand, a bank receives instructions from its customer to debit his or her account and send the funds to Bank of XYZ, the bank must act on the instructions by blocking the funds which contain a future interest of the Sudanese SDN bank. You might think of the analogy of a bouncing ball. Once the ball starts moving, you must stop it if it comes into your possession. [04-06-2005]  The updated version is notable in that it explicitly states that the opening of an account for a blocked person is a \"service.\"  Note the reference to \"wholly-owned or -controlled foreign subsidiaries.\" Does the \"wholly\" modify \"owned\" and \"controlled,\" or just \"owned\"? In other words, is the idea here that a subsidiary that is not \"wholly controlled\" by a U.S. person one that is not subject to sanctions regulations that apply to USOOC Foreign Entities?  At the margins, the scope of the term \"control\" can be difficult to pin down. One outstanding question is whether two separate entities can both pass the \"control\" threshold. To the degree that OFAC suggests here that only an entity that is \"wholly controlled\" by a U.S. financial institution is subject to 560.215 of the ITSR and its analogues in the CACR (515.329) and NKSR (510.214), that statement would indirectly have the effect of limiting the scope of what \"control\" could possibly mean.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Specifically, you indicate that the Student conducted academic research for the [                        ] in Iran in 2007, and you state that the Student is not on any \"restricted\" list. Your letter also references section 560.505(d) of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (ITSR).  The Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (ITSR), generally prohibit the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, technology, or services to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.204. This prohibition also applies to the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply of goods, technology, or services to a person in a third country undertaken with knowledge or reason to know that such goods, technology, or services are intended specifically for use in the production of, for commingling with, or for incorporation into goods, technology, or services to be directly or indirectly supplied, transshipped, or reexported exclusively or predominantly to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.204. In addition, the prohibition on the exportation, reexportation, or sale, or supply of services contained in section 560.204 of the ITSR apply to services where the benefit of such services is otherwise received in Iran, if such services are performed outside the United States by a U.S. person, and the benefit of services performed anywhere in the world on behalf of the Government of Iran is presumed to be received in Iran. ITSR. § 560.410.  Additionally, the ITSR generally prohibit U.S. persons, wherever located, from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; or goods, technology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITSR, § 560.206(a). This prohibition includes but is not limited to purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing. ITSR, § 560.206(b). The ITSR define the term U.S. person to mean any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. ITSR, § 560.314. The ITSR also prohibit any transaction or dealing in property or interests in property of the Government of Iran, an Iranian financial institution, or any other person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 560.211 of the ITSR.  Transactions with or dealings involving a person whose property or interests in property have been blocked by OFAC (\"blocked person\") require authorization from OFAC. Based on the limited information provided in the Application, it does not appear that the Student is a blocked person; however, you have not provided information regarding the Student's current employer or whether the Student is currently providing services to a blocked person. To the extent that the Student is not a blocked person and no blocked person is involved in the transaction, accepting the Student into a Master's Degree program would not constitute a provision of services to a blocked person. Separately, please note that the general license in section 560.505(d) of the ITSR does not apply to an individual participating in an educational program as an agent, employee, or contractor of the Government of Iran or a business entity or other organization in Iran.  Should you have any questions about this letter or any of the economic sanctions programs subject to OFAC's jurisdiction, you may call our office at 202-622-2480, or visit our website at www.treasury.gov/ofac.  Sincerely,                                             July 26, 2016  Davin J. Blackborow Assistant Director for Licensing  Office of Foreign Assets Control\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1)  The applicant asks whether the provision of a service to a person that has worked for a blocked person is prohibited under the ITSR. In particular, the question is whether a U.S. person may accept a student into a master’s program. OFAC does not address the source of authority for the provision of services in connection with the acceptance of a student resident in Iran. This would appear to be Iran General License (No. G), rather than 560.505.   2) The identity of the specific blocked entity at issue is redacted, but the context of the letter makes it fairly certain that the entity would meet the definition of \"Government of Iran\". The only blocking regulation cited in the letter is 560.211 of the ITSR, the work was done \"in Iran,\" and in 2015 all entities that appeared on the SDN list as blocked pursuant to the ITSR were deemed to meet the definition of \"Government of Iran\" and/or \"Iranian financial institution.\" One ordinarily does not conduct \"academic research\" for a financial institution.   In all likelihood, the applicant was concerned with the apparent breadth of the term \"Government of Iran\" as it appears in the ITSR (560.304). The term Government of Iran includes \"[a]ny person to the extent that such person is, or has been, since [August 20, 1997], acting or purporting to act, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of []\" the \"state and the Government of Iran, as well as any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof,\" or any \"person owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the foregoing.\"  OFAC is able to conclude that the acceptance of the student into the master’s program would—notwithstanding the previous work for a sanctioned entity that is very likely to meet the definition of \"Government of Iran\"—not constitute the provision of services to a blocked person. OFAC was able to come to that conclusion even without knowing whether the student was actually employed by a blocked person as of the time of the application; the question is whether there is actual blocked person involvement in the transaction that involves a U.S. person, (e.g., because the student is acting in his capacity as an official representative or otherwise on behalf of a sanctioned government or other person). This analysis is consistent with OFAC’s 2016 Publishing Guidance and FN 41 of  Internal OFAC Memorandum in Support of the Penalty Notice issued to ExxonMobil Corporation. Notwithstanding the breadth of the term \"Government of Iran\" as it appears in the ITSR, if an individual is currently employed by the Government of Iran, U.S. persons are not considered to be dealing with the Government of Iran unless the context of the transaction with the individual is one in which the individual is acting \"in his or her personal capacity (not as an official representative or otherwise on behalf of a sanctioned government)\". The same logic would presumably extend to employees of other sanctioned entities. For comments on the term \"acting on behalf of\" in general, see General Note on the Meaning and Significance of the Term \"Act on Behalf Of\", as It Appears in Various Contexts.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

If a person is within the U.S. legally, and then becomes \"ordinarily resident\" in Iran again, provisions of financial services to that person are prohibited unless specifically authorized or exempt from regulation. See Case No. IA-16053 - OFAC Response to Request for interpretive Guidance.  Compare Civil Enforcement Information - Downey Savings and Loan (2006). This case appears to involve a securities brokerage, rather than an ordinary bank.   Compare Enforcement Release: Emigrant Bank, and note that while 560.517 of the ITSR (then ITR) authorized \"[t]he maintenance of Iranian accounts, including the payment of interest and the debiting of service charges,\" there was no general authorization for operating the account (e.g. sending and receiving ordinary wires).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Background  You argue that the addition of data elements to the U.S. Company’s unpaid regular listings for Enhanced Listing subscribers consists of previously existing information, including [ text deleted ] and thus should be considered information and informational materials that are exempt from the prohibitions of the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the \"ITR\"). For subscribers at the [ text deleted ], a prominent [ text deleted ] listing that includes a company’s [ text deleted ] is added, as well as priority listing for the subscriber in search results, which we understand from the website [ text deleted ] to mean that a search result will display a [ text deleted ] subscriber’s listing above non-Enhanced Listings if the subscriber’s company meets the search criteria.  In addition to the services provided to subscribers at the [ text deleted ], [ text deleted ] subscribers obtain a [ text deleted ] on top of the search results pages, [ text deleted ] and reduced rates for additional listings and [ text deleted ]. Each category will have only one [ text deleted ] subscriber, which will be prominently displayed on the top of the company listings page in the specific category, along with its [ text deleted ].   You provide us with the URL of an Internet-based directory operated by [ text deleted ], a U.S. company you describe as providing services similar to those of the U.S. Company and listing many companies from Iran. [ text deleted ], is among the basic listings that appear on that web-page. You also clarify that customer support is provided to users of the Company’s website rather than [ text deleted ] and [ text deleted ] subscribers of the Company.  Analysis  The listing of basic information on a website in a uniform format for companies around the world, including Iran, by a U.S. person, is not prohibited by the ITR. The provision of marketing services to persons in Iran or the Government of Iran, above and beyond the mere dissemination of information in-being, however, is prohibited under the ITR.  You note in your letter that the information being added to the enhanced listings displayed on your website is based on pre-existing information supplied by customers wishing to purchase enhanced advertising from the U.S. Company. The posting of this alternative layout of information on your website regarding companies in Iran, including additional data elements of identifying information, would not be prohibited, as long as the U.S. Company does not provide any marketing services to customers in Iran or substantively enhance information provided by Iranian customers.  With regard to [ text deleted ], the U.S. Company would not be prohibited from accepting previously existing, camera-ready brochures and pictures, fully created and in existence, from Iran for placement on its website. A U.S. person may not, however, rework or otherwise enhance such images. OFAC views the publishing of online pre-existing [ text deleted ] as analogous to the activities of U.S. persons who accept information and informational materials from sanctioned countries in connection with the running of an advertisement in a newspaper. Such activity does not fall within the scope of OFAC’s regulations.  With respect to your clarification concerning the nature of your online support to searchers of your database (as opposed to entities listed in your database), OFAC can confirm that such customer support would not be prohibited by the ITR, unless the support were provided to persons in Iran.  With respect to the direct e-mail service that, according to your website, you provide as part of your enhanced listing service, the ITR do not prohibit you from enabling users of your database to e-mail a form inquiry to any of your Iranian entity subscribers, provided that you provide no services to the Iranian entity in developing or customizing the inquiry form.  Sincerely,  [Signature]  R. Richard Newcomb Director Office of Foreign Assets Control\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:   1) As discussed in the \"General Background Note on the Chronology of Guidance and interpretive Rulings Related to the Informational Materials Exemption and Publishing\", this interpretive ruling has remained on OFAC's website from 2003 up through the present, and therefore cannot be viewed as having been impacted by the portions of the 2016 Publishing Guidance that dealt with the scope of the informational materials exemption of the Berman Amendment.  This case, which expands on 030708-FACRL-IA-08 (presumably involving the same applicant), deals with information that would otherwise qualify as informational materials, i.e. info about the Iranian companies, but here the distinction is drawn between \"enhancing\" the manner in which pre-existing information is presented, vis-a-vis \"enhancing\" the information itself, where the former is exempt, and the latter prohibited.    Note that this guidance does not stand for the broad proposition that all advertising on behalf of sanctioned countries is prohibited. See FAC No. CU-156123, which clarifies that, in the case of Cuba, the provision of advertising broadcasting services is within the scope of the informational materials exemption provided that the advertising being broadcast is \"camera ready,\" i.e. not substantively altered prior to dissemination. (See also the comments to 020416-FACRL-CU-01, discussing OFAC's determination that receiving a payment from a party then-sanctioned under the SSR in connection with pay-per-click advertising was permissible). In all cases, the materials themselves existing prior to dissemination seems to be the focal point, rather than whether the dissemination of the information can be considered a \"service.\" Dissemination is obviously a service, but an exempt one in many cases.   For further commentary on the significance of this interpretive ruling as perhaps the best evidence available that certain social media and other communications-related internet services are exempt from regulation, refer to sections 2 and 3 of General Note on Prohibitions, Licenses and Exemptions as Applied to Social Media and Other Communications-Related Internet Services and Software (System Ed. Note) and Microsoft Corp. (2012 Correspondence With the SEC) (in re: Hotmail in particular).   2) Compare Upwork Inc. (2018 Correspondence With the SEC) (U.S. person allows third country persons to post solicitations for Iran-related work that U.S. persons would be prohibited from engaging in directly; characterizes such posts as exempt under the informational materials exemption).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

(\"Melli\"), a company incorporated in California, for authorization under the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (\"ITR\"), to broadcast your satellite signal to audiences in Iran. We understand from your application that Melli would be broadcasting music videos, live talk shows, live music shows, films, sports programs, and commercial advertising to audiences in Iran. You state that these programs would originate from Dubai, Iran, Germany, the United States and any other country from which the advertising originates.   Section 560.201 of the ITR generally prohibits the importation into the United States of any goods or services of Iranian-origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. Section 560.204 generally prohibits the exportation, re-exportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, technology, or services to Iran or the Government of Iran. In addition, you should be aware that the prohibitions contained in § 560.204 apply not just to services performed in the United States, but also to services performed outside the United States by a U.S. person on behalf of a person in Iran or the Government of Iran or where the benefit of such services is otherwise received in Iran. Finally, U.S. persons, wherever located, are prohibited from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to goods, technology, or services for exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITR, § 560.206(a)(2).   The prohibitions of the ITR do not apply to the importation from any country and the exportation to any country of information and informational materials, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission. ITR, § 560.210(c). The term information and informational materials includes publications, films, posters, phonograph records, photographs, microfilms , microfiche, tapes, compact disks, CD ROMS, artworks, and news wire feeds. ITR, § 560.315(a)(1) . However, § 560.210(c)(2) of the ITR provides that the information and informational materials exemption does not apply to transactions related to items not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services.[1] Finally, all transactions of common carriers incident to the receipt or transmission of telecommunications and mail between the United States and Iran are authorized. ITR, § 560.508.   [1] Section 560.538 of the ITR authorizes U.S. persons to engage in certain activities related to publishing and marketing written publications that otherwise entail the prohibited exportation of services to, or importation of services from, Iran, while maintaining restrictions on transactions with the Government of Iran.   The programs described in your application appear to fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption as defined in the ITR. In addition, the transmission of your satellite signal to Iran appears to be authorized under the general license in § 560.508 of the ITR. Therefore, an OFAC license may not be required for Melli to broadcast to Iran. However, please note that if you propose to broadcast content received from Iran, such content must be fully created and in existence prior to your acquisition of it; you may not commission the creation of such works without a license from OFAC. In addition, if you propose to broadcast advertising materials received from Iran, the materials must be fully created and in existence and not require any substantive or artistic alterations in the U.S. or by a U.S. person. Finally, you may need a license from OFAC if your advertising services substantially involve the targeting of audiences in Iran for advertisers in Iran, as a U.S. person's provision of marketing and business consulting services in Iran would not be within the scope of the exemption set forth in § 560.210(c) of the ITR. You may provide us with additional details of the nature of your proposed activities if you seek OFAC's authorization with respect to any of the above.   If you have any further questions about the ITR or the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, you may refer to our website at www.treas.gov/ofac or you may call our office at (202) 622-2480.

Unlike the applicant in Case No. IA-8274, the applicant in Case No. IA-8285 asks about broadcasting its own satellite signal to audiences in Iran, and apparently suggests that it intends on importing certain materials from Iran to \"re-export\" to Iran through the satellite-based broadcasts. Both of the applicants were relatively young companies at the time of their requests to OFAC, and both are now defunct. See \"The Satellite Subversives\" (New York Times Magazine; Feb. 24, 2002) for further relevant background (https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/magazine/the-satellite-subversives.html).   Prior to the ubiquity and ease of live streaming through the internet, \"startup\" satellite TV channels were a more common way for entities with comparatively limited resources to broadcast content to audiences in other countries. An entity could (and still can) arrange for a company such as DIRECTV or Eutelsat (direct broadcast satellite providers) to broadcast one’s content through a satellite owned or operated through the direct broadcast satellite provider. A company operating a particular channel need not produce the content broadcast, instead purchasing the rights to broadcast other entities’ content. Channels could be either free to air, as those proposed here, or paid.   In the absence of any guidance letters directly addressing streaming content through the internet, this guidance letter has obvious implications for such activities, given the conceptual parallelisms between the two types of activities.   For the version of the ITSR/ITR interpreted at the time of the issuance of the guidance letter, see https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2006-title31-vol3/xml/CFR-2006-title31-vol3-part560.xml.   2)       LIVE TV PROGRAMMING AS \"INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS\"   OFAC determines that \"music videos, live talk shows, live music shows, films, sports programs, and commercial advertising\" can constitute \"informational materials,\" as that term is defined at 560.315 of the ITR/ITSR. This is consistent with the position taken by various U.S. person entertainment and media companies that have entered into distribution agreements related to the licensing of their content, including content such as live sports, for broadcast in Iran.      3)       \"FULLY CREATED AND IN EXISTENCE\" AND LIVE TV   While OFAC has never intimated that the programs at issue could fall outside of the scope of the definition of \"informational materials,\" the transmission of live broadcasts raises questions concerning the carveout to the informational materials exemption that applies to \"transactions related to information or informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions.\" OFAC’s practice in interpreting that language is not to look at every discrete \"transaction\" related to informational materials and determine whether the transaction \"relates to\" information not yet in existence (which would necessarily describe any transaction related to the broadcast of live TV). Instead, the relevant inquiry is whether the materials are created or substantively altered at the behest of any sanctioned person. See generally Examples of the \"Substantive or Artistic Alteration or Enhancement\" and \"Fully Created and in Existence\" Standards.   4)       THE \"MARKETING SERVICES\" CARVEOUT- ADVERTISING TO SANCTIONED PERSON AUDIENCES AT THE BEHEST OF A SANCTIONED PERSON   The guidance letters are notable for their statements concerning the carveout to the informational materials exemption for \"the provision of marketing and business consulting services\". As treated in Examples of Transactions Exempt as Incident to Underlying Informational Materials Transactions, there are many examples of OFAC acknowledgement that commercial transactions related to the dissemination of commercial advertising can be exempt from regulation, provided that the commercial advertising materials the materials must be fully created and in existence and not require any substantive or artistic alterations in the U.S. or by a U.S. person.   In this letter, OFAC recognizes that \"broadcast[ing] advertising materials received from Iran\" can be exempt, provided that the materials are \"fully created and in existence,\" but OFAC warns that a specific license \"may\" be required \"if [the] advertising services substantially involve the targeting of audiences in Iran for advertisers in Iran, as a U.S. person's provision of marketing and business consulting services in Iran would not be within the scope of the exemption set forth in § 560.210(c).\"   The question raised here, to which there is no clear-cut answer of which we are aware, is when does the dissemination of informational materials at the behest of a sanctioned person constitute \"the provision of marketing and business consulting services.\"   OFAC’s guidance makes clear that a U.S. person contracting a sanctioned person to place a \"fully created\" advertisement in a magazine located in a sanctioned country is exempt (Case No. IA-2013-303519) (see also FAQ # 348). This is true even where the ads \"involve the targeting of audiences in\" a sanctioned country.   It is not the case that the dissemination of advertising-related informational materials at the behest of a sanctioned person constitutes a \"marketing…service[]\" simply because the advertiser is a sanctioned person. See FAC No. CU-156123 (U.S. person radio station may broadcast an advertisement for a Cuban person, though in that case the audience targeted was presumably a U.S.-based audience).   As it relates to U.S. persons engaging in advertising-related transactions for Iranian entities where the ads themselves (presumably) target Iranian audiences, this too is not categorically excluded from the informational materials exemption. See 031211-FACRL-IA-14 (Posting of Information from Iran on Website, from 2003 and on OFAC’s website as of 8/2021).   It is not clear precisely what constitutes \"the line\" between the mere dissemination of informational materials and prohibited \"marketing services,\" but the inquiry would seem to focus on the degree to which the U.S. person-provided services extend beyond those necessary for the dissemination of the pre-existing advertising materials. In 031211-FACRL-IA-14 OFAC warns that providing \"customer support\" to persons in Iran is not exempt, even if U.S. persons may accept advertising materials from them and post them on the internet for a fee.   There is some cause to suspect that the inquiry focuses on the degree to which the U.S. person assists in the actual \"targeting\" of customers on behalf of a sanctioned person (even if through the use of a computer program). See Interpretive Guidance and Statement of Licensing Policy on Internet Freedom in Iran – 2012, specifying that allowing sanctioned persons access to \"[o]nline advertising programs (e.g., AdSense and AdWords) [that] empower [sanctioned person] publishers to earn revenue by displaying relevant ads on their content\" is not exempt, and it is of no consequence that the publishers may be advertising the sale of materials that, themselves, qualify for the informational materials exemption. Given that OFAC's interpretation of the exemption generally tracks the degree to which an associated service is genuinely incident to the dissemination of informational materials, it would make sense for OFAC to draw a \"marketing services\" line at services related to the actual act of \"targeting\" audiences as the behest of sanctioned person advertisers (e.g. the determinations of what ads to run and when for the purposes of achieving maximum effect), especially when such \"targeting-related\" services can be segregated from, i.e. are not genuinely necessary for, the dissemination of the materials in question.   5)       THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS GL – THE MEANING OF \"OF COMMON CARRIERS\" – SATELLITE-BROADCASTING TRANSACTIONS NOT EXEMPT    The version of the ITSR/ITR interpreted in the guidance letter contained a version of 560.508 that provides as follows:   § 560.508 Telecommunications and mail transactions authorized. All transactions of common carriers incident to the receipt or transmission of telecommunications and mail between the United States and Iran are authorized. For purposes of this section, the term mail includes parcels only to the extent the parcels contain goods exempted from the prohibitions contained in this part or otherwise eligible for importation from or exportation to Iran under a general or specific license.   In 2012, when the ITSR was reissued as the ITR, OFAC reformulated the above as 560.508(c), which provides as follows:  (c) All transactions by U.S. persons, including payment and transfers to common carriers, incident to the receipt or transmission of mail between the United States and Iran are authorized, provided that mail is limited to personal communications not involving a transfer of anything of value. For purposes of this section, the term mail includes parcels only to the extent the parcels contain goods exempted from the prohibitions contained in this part or otherwise eligible for importation from or exportation to Iran under a general or specific license.   Note the shift from \"All transactions of common carriers \" to \"transactions by U.S. persons, including payment and transfers to common carriers.\" Note, in addition, that the \"All transactions of common carriers\" can still be found in certain telecommunications-related GLs, i.e. 510.516 (NKSR), 542.519 (SySR), Ukraine General License Number 8 (Crimea) and Venezuela General License 24 (Venezuela).   OFAC’s interpretation of 560.508 is arguably of greater current consequence for the non-Iran embargo programs of which the telecommunications GL is cast in terms of \"All transactions of common carriers\"  In Case No. IA-8285, OFAC determines that \"the transmission of [the U.S. person’s] satellite signal to Iran appears to be authorized under the general license in § 560.508 of the ITR.\"  However, the applicant (Melli TV & Radio, Inc.) was clearly not, itself a \"common carrier\" as the companies that actually own and operate satellites might be. Nevertheless, OFAC impliedly considers transactions related to the transmission of the satellite signal to be transactions \"of\" common carriers.   The distinction between \"transactions of common carriers\" and \"to \"transactions by U.S. persons, including payment and transfers to common carriers\" is, in theory, significant. Note, however, that OFAC appears to interpret \"transactions of common carriers\" (in the GLs in which that construction still exists) as if the construction were \"transactions by U.S. persons, including payment and transfers to common carriers\". See Case No. SY-2015-315677-1, in which OFAC characterizes the transactions authorized by the \"of common carriers\" version of the standard telecommunications and mail GL as if it had been amended to read \"transactions by U.S. persons, including payment and transfers to common carriers\".  Apart from the guidance concerning the scope of the current 560.508(c) as it relates to the broadcasting of satellite signals, note that the guidance appears to imply that such transactions are not exempt from regulation as incident to the dissemination of ready-made informational materials.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

The apparent violations arose out of a personal relationship that the Individual maintained with the specially designated narcotics trafficker while the Individual was stationed overseas at a U.S. embassy in Colombia.\n=== END KEY FACTS ===\n\n=== DOCUMENT TEXT ===\nEnforcement Release: August 11, 2020  OFAC Settles with an Individual with Respect to Potential Civil Liability for Apparent Violations of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations  A natural U.S. person (\"U.S. Person-1\") has agreed to pay $5,000 to settle their potential civil liability for engaging in at least 24 transactions for the benefit of a foreign individual who at the time was a specially designated narcotics trafficker. The apparent violations arose out of a personal relationship that U.S. Person-1 maintained with the specially designated narcotics trafficker while U.S. Person-1 was stationed overseas at a U.S. embassy.  Description of the Apparent Violations and the Conduct Leading to the Apparent Violations  At the time of the apparent violations, U.S. Person-1 was a civilian direct hire of the U.S. Army and stationed in the U.S. embassy in Bogota, Colombia (the \"embassy\"). U.S. Person-1’s position at the embassy required a security clearance. U.S. Person-1 also held many national security-related positions prior to being stationed at the embassy.  In 2015, the foreign individual, who at the time was a specially designated narcotics trafficker (\"SDNT-1\"), was in the embassy for a meeting regarding their designation status (the \"embassy meeting\").[1] For the embassy meeting, SDNT-1 was accompanied by a former host nation official who OFAC would also later designate as a specially designated narcotics trafficker (\"SDNT-2\"). Although U.S. Person-1 was not party to the embassy meeting nor involved in the topics discussed, U.S. Person-1 had a preexisting professional relationship with SDNT-2 at the time.[2] After the embassy meeting, SDNT-2 introduced SDNT-1 to U.S. Person-1. Shortly thereafter, U.S. Person-1 and SDNT-1 maintained contact and started a personal relationship.  [1] U.S. Person-1 is not, and has never been, affiliated with or employed by OFAC. U.S. Person-1 did not participate in, attend, or have any direct or indirect role in the embassy meeting. [2] SDNT-2 was not designated until after U.S. Person-1 engaged in the Apparent Violations with SDNT-1.  U.S. Person-1 was aware that they were having a personal relationship with a specially designated narcotics trafficker. Nonetheless, over the course of a year, U.S. Person-1 bought jewelry, meals, clothing, hotel rooms, and other gifts for SDNT-1 while SDNT-1 was seeking to be removed from the SDN List. During the relationship, U.S. Person-1 conducted internet research concerning the legality of engaging in transactions with persons on OFAC’s Specially Designated National and Blocked Persons List (the \"SDN List\"), but did not seek further counseling or advice from the various government and legal resources that were readily available in the embassy or by their employer.  As a result, U.S. Person-1 appears to have violated 31 C.F.R. § 598.203 of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 598 (FNKSR) on at least 24 occasions when U.S. Person-1 engaged in transactions that constituted prohibited dealings in blocked property or interests in property of an individual previously identified on the SDN List as a specially designated narcotics trafficker (the \"Apparent Violations\"). The total transaction value of the Apparent Violations was about $3,349.33.  Penalty Calculations and General Factors Analysis  The statutory maximum civil monetary penalty applicable in this matter is $36,264,793. OFAC determined that U.S. Person-1 did not voluntarily self-disclose the Apparent Violations and that the Apparent Violations constitute an egregious case. Accordingly, under OFAC’s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines (\"Enforcement Guidelines\"), the base civil monetary penalty amount applicable in this matter is the statutory maximum of $36,264,793.  The settlement amount of $5,000 reflects OFAC’s consideration of the General Factors under the Enforcement Guidelines. Specifically, OFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:  (1)  U.S. Person-1 failed to exercise an appropriate degree of caution or care with respect to the conduct that led to the Apparent Violations. This included, but was not limited to, U.S. Person-1’s failure to approach or use any of the OFAC personnel or other resources available to them to resolve issues arising from forming a new relationship with a foreign person who was also a specially designated narcotics trafficker; (2)  U.S. Person-1 was aware that they formed and then maintained a voluntary relationship with a specially designated narcotics trafficker and had actual knowledge of the conduct that led to the Apparent Violations; (3)  U.S. Person-1’s relationship and transactions with a specially designated narcotics trafficker while that person sought reconsideration of their designation created a perception of impropriety that harms the integrity of all sanctions programs; and (4)  As a U.S. government employee stationed overseas in a national security position, U.S. Person-1 failed to exercise judgment and an expected degree of caution or care commensurate with that position.  OFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors:  (1)  U.S. Person-1 was relieved of their duties and is no longer employed by the U.S. government. Additionally, the U.S. Army has taken significant disciplinary action against U.S. Person-1 in connection with this matter; (2)  U.S. Person-1 is a natural person who does not appear to have any prior experience with sanctions compliance; (3)  Most of the transactions engaged in by U.S. Person-1 for or on behalf of the specially designated narcotics trafficker appear to have been personal in nature and involve goods with a single, immediate, and one-time use with limited or exhausted secondary value; and (4)  U.S. Person-1 cooperated with OFAC when interviewed and was expeditious and organized in their subpoena response and subsequent communications.  Compliance Considerations  All U.S. persons, including members of the military and civil service stationed abroad, should exercise caution before voluntarily engaging in relationships with foreign persons that the U.S. person knows, or reasonably should know, may have a sanctions nexus, as any financial transaction or exchange of goods or services with a designated person — even in the context of a personal relationship — may constitute a violation of U.S. sanctions. Those serving in national security positions should be particularly cautious, especially when their voluntary relationships can harm or give the appearance of harming the integrity of government processes.  OFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources  For more information regarding OFAC regulations, please go to: www.treasury.gov/ofac.  Information concerning the civil penalties process can be found in the OFAC regulations governing each sanctions program; the Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 501; and the Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. part 501, app. A. These references, as well as recent final civil penalties and enforcement information, can be found on OFAC’s website at www.treasury.gov/ofac/enforcement.  On May 2, 2019, OFAC published A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments in order to provide organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in or with the United States or U.S. persons, or that use U.S.-origin goods or services, with OFAC’s perspective on the essential components of a sanctions compliance program. The Framework also outlines how OFAC may incorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations and resolution of investigations resulting in settlements. The Framework includes an appendix that offers a brief analysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs OFAC has identified during its investigative process.\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) For a civil enforcement action, this is an extremely unusual case for a number of reasons. We first note that this is the first civil enforcement action that is solely against an individual (see An Unnamed Individual (16) (2004)). It is also the first civil enforcement action brought against a person employed by the U.S. government at the time of the alleged violations.  The case is also extremely unusual from a factual standpoint. The activities that resulted in the enforcement action appear to be wholly non-commercial in nature, which itself is quite rare. The provision of material goods to a blocked person is generally a clear violation of the blocking prohibition, but in this case the facts strongly suggest that the U.S. person at issue was involved in a romantic relationship with the blocked person (jewelry, hotel rooms...), and in any case it is clear that the goods provided were non-commercial in nature.   In this case, the blocked person was blocked pursuant to the FNKSR—which is one of the most restrictive sanctions programs as it relates to exemptions and general licenses—but the facts of the case arising solely out of a \"personal relationship\" leads one to wonder just how far OFAC would consider sanctions prohibitions to extend to situations where U.S. persons that have personal and/or romantic relationships with ordinary citizens of embargoed countries. For example, a blocked Cuban citizen located in a third country or any non-blocked individual that is \"ordinarily resident\" in Iran, Syria or Crimea. Does buying one such person dinner constitute an export of the dinner \"to\" the embargoed country? Up until the release of this enforcement action web post, such questions were often raised as interesting hypotheticals but were only theoretical because, in practice, OFAC did not police wholly non-commercial relationships between U.S. persons and sanctioned individuals. If forced to, OFAC could distinguish this case from the clearly more benign ones by pointing to the fact that the U.S. person involved had a security clearance and that the blocked person at issue was an SDNT, such that the relationship itself may have compromised national security even in the absence of the gift giving. It is also worth noting that, in comprehensive embargo programs such as the ITSR and SySR, the travel exemption may exempt some of the non-commercial activities that in this case were deemed to violate the FNKSR (the ITSR also has a low-value gift GL, see 560.506). In any event, if the purpose of this enforcement action is—as suggested by the \"Compliance Considerations\" portion of the notice—to produce a chilling effect as it relates to \"personal relationship[s]\" between U.S. persons and sanctioned individuals, this enforcement release is likely to have that effect, particularly as it relates to persons in the employ of the U.S. government.   Finally, note that while the FNKSR does not contain a \"personal communications\" exemption, here OFAC does not suggest that the \"personal relationship\" was a \"per se\" violation of the blocking prohibition of the FNKSR. Instead, OFAC appears to limit its application of the blocking prohibition strictly to discrete \"transactions\" that involved the provision of goods with some quantifiable (if de minimis) value.   Compare FAC No. 105290 (suggesting a zone of tolerance made up of certain activities that are both de minimis and non-commercial in nature). To the degree that FAC No. 105290 has cross-programmatic implications, they may be limited to territory-based embargoes, as opposed to list-based sanctions programs such as the FNKSR.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Specifically, OFAC alleged that from on or about May 21, 2007, to on or about November 12, 2009, the individual exported, sold, and/or supplied unlicensed medical goods and/or related financial services from the United States to Iran, in violation of the ITSR.

(\"Amazon\"), a Seattle, Washington-based company that provides retail, e- commerce, and digital services to millions of customers worldwide, has agreed to pay $134,523 to settle its potential civil liability for apparent violations of multiple OFAC sanctions programs. As a result of deficiencies related to Amazon’s sanctions screening processes, Amazon provided goods and services to persons sanctioned by OFAC; to persons located in the sanctioned region or countries of Crimea, Iran, and Syria; and to individuals located in or employed by the foreign missions of countries sanctioned by OFAC. Amazon also failed to timely report several hundred transactions conducted pursuant to a general license issued by OFAC that included a mandatory reporting requirement, thereby nullifying that authorization with respect to those transactions. The settlement amount reflects OFAC’s determination that Amazon’s apparent violations were non-egregious and voluntarily self-disclosed, and further reflects the significant remedial measures implemented by Amazon upon discovery of the apparent violations.  Description of the Apparent Violations and the Conduct Leading to the Apparent Violations  From on or about November 15, 2011, to on or about October 18, 2018, persons located in Crimea, Iran, and Syria placed orders or otherwise conducted business on Amazon’s websites for consumer and retail goods and services where the transaction details demonstrated that the goods or services would be provided to persons in Crimea, Iran, or Syria. Amazon also accepted and processed orders on its websites for persons located in or employed by the foreign missions of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.  Additionally, Amazon accepted and processed orders from persons listed on OFAC’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the \"SDN List\") who were blocked pursuant to the Narcotics Trafficking Sanctions Regulations, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, the Transnational Criminal Organizations Sanctions Regulations, the Democratic Republic of the Congo Sanctions Regulations, the Venezuela Sanctions Regulations, the Zimbabwe Sanctions Regulations, the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, and the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations. Overall, the apparent violations consisted primarily of transactions involving low-value retail goods and services for which the total transaction value of the apparent violations was approximately $269,000.  These apparent violations occurred primarily because Amazon’s automated sanctions screening processes failed to fully analyze all transaction and customer data relevant to compliance with OFAC’s sanctions regulations. In some instances, orders specifically referenced a sanctioned jurisdiction, a city within a sanctioned jurisdiction, or a common alternative spelling of a sanctioned jurisdiction, yet Amazon’s screening processes did not flag the transactions for review. For example, Amazon’s screening processes did not flag orders with address fields containing an address in \"Yalta, Krimea\" for the term \"Yalta,\" a city in Crimea, nor for the variation of the spelling of Crimea. In another example, Amazon failed to interdict or otherwise flag orders shipped to the Embassy of Iran located in third countries. Moreover, in several hundred instances, Amazon’s automated sanctions screening processes failed to flag the correctly spelled names and addresses of persons on OFAC’s SDN List.  Accordingly, this conduct resulted in apparent violations of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515 (CACR); the Democratic Republic of the Congo Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 547 (DRCSR); the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 598 (FNKSR); the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R.

Part 591 (VSR); the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 539 (WMDPSR); and the Zimbabwe Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 541 (ZSR).  [1] Effective January 17, 2017, all transactions prohibited under the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations are authorized pursuant to the general license located at 31 C.F.R. § 538.540. The general license does not affect past, present, or future OFAC enforcement investigations or actions related to any apparent violations of the SSR relating to activities that occurred prior to the effective date of the general license.  Finally, Amazon disclosed to OFAC that it failed to report 362 transactions involving Crimea that it had conducted pursuant to General License No. 5, \"Authorizing Certain Activities Prohibited by Executive Order 13685 of December 19, 2014 Necessary to Wind Down Operations Involving the Crimea Region of Ukraine\" (GL 5), which authorized certain transactions prohibited by E.O. 13685 through February 1, 2015. The terms of GL 5 included a requirement that transactions authorized by GL 5 be reported within 10 days after the wind-down activities concluded. As stated in § 501.801(a) of the Reporting, Procedure and Penalties Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 501, \"Persons availing themselves of certain general licenses may be required to file reports and statements in accordance with the instructions specified in those licenses. Failure to file timely all required information in such reports or statements may nullify the authorization otherwise provided by the general license and result in apparent violations of the applicable prohibitions that may be subject to OFAC enforcement action.\" Amazon previously identified and reported to OFAC 245 transactions involving Crimea undertaken pursuant to GL 5 on February 13, 2015 (within the required reporting period), but did not report an additional 362 such transactions until well after the required reporting period had expired. Because of this reporting failure, the authorization in GL 5 is nullified with respect to those 362 transactions.  Penalty Calculation and General Factors Analysis  The statutory maximum civil monetary penalty amount for the apparent violations was $1,038,206,212. However, OFAC determined that Amazon voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations and that the apparent violations constitute a non-egregious case.  Accordingly, under OFAC’s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. Part 501, app. A., the base civil monetary penalty amount for the apparent violations equals the sum of one-half of the transaction value for each apparent violation, which in this case is $134,523.  The settlement amount of $134,523 reflects OFAC’s consideration of the General Factors under the Enforcement Guidelines.  OFAC considered the following to be aggravating factors:  (1)  Amazon failed to exercise due caution or care when it implemented sanctions screening processes that failed to properly flag transactions involving blocked persons and sanctioned jurisdictions. In particular, Amazon did not properly review or assess addresses, customer names, or common variations of such data as part of its sanctions screening. (2)  While the apparent violations primarily involved the provision of low-value retail and consumer goods and services, some of the apparent violations related to Amazon’s processing of orders for personal security products on behalf of persons located at the Iranian embassies in Tokyo, Japan, and in Brussels, Belgium. (3)  Amazon provides consumer goods and services via its e-commerce websites and processes billions of global transactions annually, and is one of the largest and most commercially sophisticated companies in the world.  OFAC considered the following to be mitigating factors:  (1)  Amazon had not received a penalty notice or Finding of Violation from OFAC in the five years preceding the earliest date of the transactions giving rise to the apparent violations. (2)  Amazon voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations to OFAC, cooperated with OFAC’s investigation by providing data analysis of the apparent violations and submitting detailed information in a well-organized manner, and entered into tolling agreements with OFAC. In addition, Amazon conducted an internal investigation without receiving an administrative subpoena and identified and disclosed the circumstances of the transactions that led to the apparent violations. (3)  Upon discovering the apparent violations, Amazon undertook significant remedial measures to address its sanctions screening deficiencies and has also agreed as part of its settlement with OFAC to undertake various additional sanctions compliance commitments designed to minimize the risk of recurrence of similar conduct in the future. Such measures include:  •  Investing substantial resources to improve Amazon’s overall sanctions compliance program, including by actively engaging senior management on its compliance improvements, adding significant headcount to its compliance teams, and increasing the frequency of its sanctions compliance reviews; •  Employing internal and third-party sources to conduct a thorough review of Amazon’s sanctions compliance program and its automated screening systems in order to address the screening failures that gave rise to the apparent violations. In particular, Amazon is incorporating additional automated preventative screening controls designed to scale and operate effectively for its overall retail business; •  Developing internally custom screening lists to minimize the risk of processing transactions that raise sanctions compliance concerns; •  Enhancing its sanctioned jurisdiction Internet Protocol (IP) blocking controls and implementing automated processes to update continually its mapping of IP ranges associated with sanctioned jurisdictions; •  Bolstering its compliance training programs by providing training tailored to the roles of specific teams and specialized ad-hoc training to personnel responsible for sanctions and export control compliance; and •  Expanding the use of specific export control and sanctions provisions and the language of those provisions in its agreements.  Compliance Considerations  This case demonstrates the importance of implementing and maintaining effective, risk-based sanctions compliance controls, including sanctions screening measures appropriate for e- commerce and other internet-based businesses that operate on a global scale. Such large and sophisticated businesses should implement and employ compliance tools and programs that are commensurate with the speed and scale of their business operations. In particular, global companies that rely heavily on automated sanctions screening processes should take reasonable, risk-based steps to ensure that their processes are appropriately configured to screen relevant customer information and to capture data quality issues, such as common misspellings. Routine testing of these processes to ensure effectiveness and identify deficiencies may also be appropriate. Moreover, companies that learn of a weakness in their internal compliance controls may benefit by taking immediate and effective action, to the extent possible, to identify and implement compensating controls until the root cause of the weakness can be determined and remediated.  This case also demonstrates the importance of compliance with all aspects of the terms of OFAC’s general licenses, including the timely fulfillment of any reporting obligations pursuant to those licenses.  OFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources  On May 2, 2019, OFAC published A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments in order to provide organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in or with the United States or U.S. persons, or that use U.S.-origin goods or services, with OFAC’s perspective on the essential components of a sanctions compliance program. The Framework also outlines how OFAC may incorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations and resolution of investigations resulting in settlements. The Framework includes an appendix that offers a brief analysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs OFAC has identified during its investigative process.  Information concerning the civil penalties process can be found in the OFAC regulations governing each sanctions program; the Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 501; and the Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. Part 501, app. A. These references, as well as recent final civil penalties and enforcement information, can be found on OFAC’s website at www.treasury.gov/ofac/enforcement.  For more information regarding OFAC regulations, please go to: www.treasury.gov/ofac.\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) BASES FOR LIABILITY  a) The \"Service\" Export Prohibitions (Non-blocked Persons)  OFAC alleges violations of the Crimea, Iran and Syria embargoes in connection with the provision of goods and/or services \"to persons located in the sanctioned region or countries of Crimea, Iran, and Syria.\" These are presumably all violations of the broad prohibition on the provision of services (and/or goods except in the case of Syria) to persons \"in\" or \"ordinarily resident in\" a given sanctioned destination. In this case, OFAC made no mention of the \"ordinarily resident\" standard, suggesting that the IP and/or physical addresses of the persons at issue were the basis on which to conclude that the recipient of the services was \"in\" a sanctioned destination. Compare Civil Enforcement Information - Standard Chartered Bank (Second Global Settlement).  b) The Reporting Requirement in Ukraine GL 5  OFAC alleges that \"Amazon also failed to timely report several hundred transactions conducted pursuant to [Ukraine General License Number 5] that included a mandatory reporting requirement, thereby nullifying that authorization with respect to those transactions.\" This appears to be the first time that OFAC has ever charged violations of this manner, and the enforcement action clarifies that failure to comply with reporting requirements has the effect of nullifying the GL. The reporting requirement at issue was worded as follows \"U.S. persons participating in transactions authorized by this general license are required, within 10 business days after the wind-down activities conclude, to file a detailed report, including the parties involved, the type and scope of activities conducted, and the dates of the activities, with the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Licensing Division, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W., Annex, Washington, DC 20220.\" OFAC cites § 501.801(a) of the RPPR, which states that \"[p]ersons availing themselves of certain general licenses may be required to file reports and statements in accordance with the instructions specified in those licenses. Failure to file timely all required information in such reports or statements may nullify the authorization…\" Given that the GL did not state that the validity of the authorizations were contingent on meeting the reporting requirement, it would probably be wise to read \"may nullify the authorization\" in 501.801(a) to mean \"will nullify the authorization.\"  c) Persons located in or employed by the foreign missions of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria  OFAC says that \"Amazon also accepted and processed orders on its websites for persons located in or employed by the foreign missions of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.\" Amazon processed \"orders for personal security products on behalf of persons located at the Iranian embassies in Tokyo, Japan, and in Brussels, Belgium.\" The violations for \"orders shipped to the Embassy of Iran located in third countries,\" or \"persons located at\" those embassies would have violated 560.211 of the ITSR, as all such embassies meet the definition of \"Government of Iran.\" There is no GL in the ITSR for dealings involving third country Iranian embassies, only Iranian Government missions in the United States (560.512) and third country diplomatic missions in Iran (560.541). To the extent that other embargo programs (e.g. the SySR and CACR) have GLs for diplomatic missions, it is also the case that the GLs apply to missions of sanctioned countries in the U.S. and third country missions in the sanctioned countries, but not missions of the sanctioned countries in third countries.   d) The SDNs  The enforcement notice also states that Amazon \"accepted and processed orders from persons listed on [the SDN list] who were blocked pursuant to\" various blocking regulations. The mere processing of orders for such persons, even without the delivery of items, would constitute the \"the making of any contribution or provision of…services by, to, or for the benefit of any [blocked] person.\"  2) THE SCREENING ISSUES  OFAC mentions deficiencies in Amazon’s automated sanctions screening processes, all of which are of a type that have resulted in enforcement actions in the past. As it relates to the \"alternate spelling\" issue, OFAC has found violations where alternate spellings of sanctioned persons were missed by sanctions screening software, but not alternate spellings of cities in sanctioned destinations.  3) THE PENALTY  Amazon paid $134,523 to settle violations with a statutory maximum of $1,038,206,212. This was due to the fact that the violations were deemed non-egregious and were voluntarily disclosed, so the base penalty was one-half of the transaction value. We are unaware of any other instance in which there was as large a gap between the statutory maximum of a set of violations and the actual settlement amount.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

If a non-sanctioned person files a claim with their insurance company for a loss caused by a blocked person, such as a designated terrorist organization, is the insurance company permitted to pay the claim?   OFAC is aware that insurers at times receive claims from non-sanctioned persons in non-comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions for losses caused by individuals or entities on OFAC's List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List). For example, a U.S. insurance company may receive a claim request for death, injury, or property damage caused by a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. Under this scenario, the mere fact that a blocked person has caused the loss does not in and of itself create a blocked interest in the policy or any claim or payment under the policy, nor does it constitute a dealing involving the blocked person. Therefore, U.S. insurers may pay such claims to non-sanctioned recipients, provided the payment is not prohibited by other OFAC sanctions regulations (e.g., the recipient resides in a sanctioned jurisdiction and no other authorization applies). This guidance does not apply to scenarios in which a person is seeking reimbursement for payments that were made or will be made to a blocked person.  OFAC encourages insurers who receive claims for losses caused by a blocked person to conduct necessary due diligence to ensure there are no other potential sanctions risks associated with making or facilitating related claim payments (e.g., the involvement of a blocked financial institution).  OFAC is aware that some insurance policies may include subrogation rights, which provide a legal right for the insurer to pursue reimbursement from the liable third-party for payment of the claim. The mere existence of such rights in a situation involving a loss caused by a blocked person does not create an interest of the blocked person in the policy or claims made under the policy. However, claims paid as described above and all other obligations of the insurer on behalf of the insured (or their non-sanctioned beneficiaries) under a given policy must not be contingent on the successful pursuit of a subrogated claim by the insurer against a blocked person.  OFAC does not require U.S. persons to obtain a specific license to initiate legal proceedings against a blocked person. For example, a U.S. attorney, insurer, or other service provider initiating arbitral proceedings against a Specially Designated Global Terrorist does not require a specific license. In most OFAC programs, however, a license would generally be required to enter a settlement agreement with a blocked person, to accept payment from a blocked person, or to enforce an order or award transferring blocked property. Please see the relevant OFAC implementing regulations and the Sanctions Programs and Country Information page on OFAC's website for further program-specific information. For guidance on how to request and apply for a specific license, please see 31 CFR § 501.801 and the License Application page on OFAC's website.  Date Released November 13, 2024\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1)  This guidance, issued on 11-13-24 concurrent with amendments to a number of other historic insurance-related FAQs (e.g. FAQ # 63 and FAQ # 64), makes a number of precedential statements concerning the relationship between the blocking prohibition and insurance policies. Most notably, OFAC clarifies that an \"insurance company [may be] permitted to pay [a] claim\" to a non-sanctioned person where the losses are caused by blocked persons. The example given is \"a U.S. insurance company may receive a claim request for death, injury, or property damage caused by a Specially Designated Global Terrorist\". OFAC says that \"the mere fact that a blocked person has caused the loss does not in and of itself create a blocked interest in the policy or any claim or payment under the policy, nor does it constitute a dealing involving the blocked person\". This is a crucially important limitation to the otherwise extremely broad notion of an \"interest\" in property of a blocked person. Normally, and payment directly or indirectly \"involving\" a blocked person is one in which a blocked person has an interest, but not here.  It is important to consider the tension between a blocked person not having an \"interest\" in such payments, and the question of whether, by having insured against a loss caused by a blocked person, the insurance company’s provision of the insurance was a prohibited facilitation of losses involving sanctions-implicating conduct (see FAQ # 102). If, for example, an insurer insures a hotel against all losses and a terrorist organization randomly comes along and bombs the hotel, the initial provision of insurance to the hotel is not the sort of thing that could be said to have benefitted or facilitated dealings with the terrorist organization. But what if, for example, a claim made by a non-sanctioned arises from it having been defrauded by a sanctioned person in connection with an underlying business dealing involving the sanctioned person?    2)  With respect to the \"subrogation\" issues, here again it is highly notable (and precedential) that OFAC concludes that the existence of a subrogation right focusing on a blocked person does mean that the underlying payment of a claim is one in which the blocked person has an interest (so long as the payment of a claim is not \"contingent on the successful pursuit of a subrogated claim by the insurer against a blocked person\". Query whether this guidance has any scope of application in the context of general debts.   3)  The litigation-related guidance in the final paragraph is consistent with OFAC statements on the matter in general. Refer to General Note Concerning Unlicensed Litigation Involving Sanctioned Persons or Property; the Question of Whether Judicial Action Constitutes the Unlicensed \"Transfer\" of Blocked Property (System Ed. Note).  \n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Iran: Travel Exemption\n=== END TITLE ===\n\n=== DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n031125-FACRL-IA-12 November 25, 2003  IRAN: TRAVEL EXEMPTION FAC No. [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  Dear [text deleted]:    This is with regard to your letters of January 9, 2003, June 6, 2003, and June 12, 2003 to the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") on behalf of [a U.S. person]. In your letters you inquired whether the travel exemption provisions contained in § 560.210(d) of the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the \"Regulations\"), authorize [U.S. persons] to engage in the following activities involving the arrangement of air travel between the United States and Iran:  1)  Publication of schedules of flights between Europe and Iran; 2)  Publication of interline airfares; 3)  Acceptance of reservations for travel between the United States and Iran; 4)  Issuance of airline tickets for the entire trip between the United States and Iran; and 5)  Advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran.  Section 560.204 of the Regulations prohibits the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, technology, or services to Iran or the Government of Iran. However, § 560.210(c) of the Regulations provides that the prohibitions do not apply to the importation from and the exportation to any country of information and informational materials fully created and in existence at the time of the transaction.In addition, § 560.210(d) of the Regulations provides that the prohibitions contained in § 560.204 do not apply to transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, including importation of accompanied baggage for personal use, maintenance within any country including payment of living expenses and acquisition of goods or services for personal use, and arrangement or facilitation of such travel including nonscheduled air, sea, or land voyages. Section 560.210(d) of the Regulations further provides that the exemption extends to transactions with Iranian carriers and those involving group tours and payments in Iran made for transactions directly incident to travel.   Based upon the information submitted, we have concluded that, with the exceptions noted below, the exemptions set forth in § 560.210 (c and d) of the Regulations are applicable to all of the above listed activities involving airline travel between the United States and Iran.  With respect to the advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran, the Regulations do not prohibit such transactions unless they are undertaken at the behest of a person in Iran or an Iranian entity. The Regulations would prohibit advertising-related transactions undertaken at the behest of a person or entity in Iran, unless the information or informational materials exemption applies. To fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption, such transactions must be limited to the direct dissemination of copy-ready materials. A U.S. person cannot provide any other related services to Iran, such as the development of advertising materials or an advertising campaign or serving as an agent for the buying or brokering of advertising space, without OFAC authorization. Such activities do not fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption. Such activities also would not fall within the scope of the travel exemption, as they are not directly incident to travel.  Although the travel exemption set forth in § 560.210(d) of the Regulations applies regardless of whether the connecting carrier is Iran Air or another Iranian air carrier, it applies only to arranging travel and should not be construed to authorize transactions not directly incident to travel, such as the creation or enhancement of a travel reservation service in Iran. Further, while [U.S. persons] are authorized to accept reservations, issue tickets for travel on Iranian carriers, and advertise air service between the United States and Iran (subject to the caveats referenced above), any U.S. origin financial services used to exchange payments with Iran must fall within the scope of the authorizations set forth in § 560.516 of the Regulations, which necessitate the use of non-U.S., non-Iranian financial institutions as intermediaries to such transactions.  If you have any additional questions about the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, you may refer to our web site at www.treas.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.   Sincerely,   [Signature]  R. Richard Newcomb Director Office of Foreign Assets Control    \n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) The Guidance analyzes a set of transactions at the intersection of the Berman Amendment exemptions for travel and transactions ordinarily incident thereto (560.210(d)) and the exemption for informational materials transactions (560.210(c)).   With regard to OFAC's declaration that \"the Regulations do not prohibit [the advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran] unless they are undertaken at the behest of a person in Iran or an Iranian entity,\" compare FAC No. CU-156123, considering a Cuban travel company paying a U.S. person to broadcast advertising as being within the scope of informational materials exemption (i.e. where the travel exemption was not available). The reason why the advertising generally is not permitted is because OFAC deems it i) not ordinarily incident to travel, and ii) more of a service than a transaction incident to the import/export of informational materials, but when the advertising transaction only involves the dissemination of pre-existing materials, it is exempt. [1] As confirmed by FAC No. CU-156123, \"copy ready\" does not imply that qualifying materials cannot be in audio/visual format.   2) Other guidance clarifies OFAC's positions on the publication of fares and acceptance of reservations (FACRL-CU-01 2002), acting as a travel agent (Case No. IA-17270) and dealing with an entity designated pursuant to a sanctions program with a travel exemption (Case No. IA-16194). See also our discussion on SEC filings describing activities done by companies purporting to act under the Berman Amendment exemptions for travel.   Compare Case No. IA-17270 with the statement that \"the creation or enhancement of a travel reservation service in Iran\" is prohibited.  Case No. IA-17270, issued 10 years after the publication of this guidance, seems to stand for the proposition that doing more than simply accepting reservations is exempt, at least in connection with Iranians traveling to the U.S.  3) Guidance should apply generally to all IEEPA-based programs with a travel exemption. With respect to Cuba, a combination of the informational materials exemption of the CACR combined with current general licenses related to travel will have much the same result, but not in all cases.    4) See Delta Air Lines, Inc., Correspondence with the SEC Office of Global Security Risk (2007): sale of tickets pursuant to codeshare agreements considered exempt when the tickets involve travel to sanctioned destinations other than Cuba.  [1] Refer to section 2(I) of the \"Ordinarily Incident\" System Note; comment to Case No. IA-2012-299245-1.  5) See Iran-Related Civil Aviation Industry Advisory (2019), and comments thereto, concerning the relationship between primary and secondary sanctions in the aviation industry.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

  "answer": "Yes. Broadcasting an advertisement on behalf of a sanctioned person can be allowed under OFAC rules—provided the transaction falls within the informational materials exemption. For example, in [FAC No. CU-156123], OFAC explained that a U.S. radio station’s broadcast of a pre‐existing, “copy‐ready” commercial audio tape for a Cuban national was not subject to licensing because the station was merely disseminating the material as provided without any alteration or added marketing services. Similarly, [031211-FACRL-IA-14] and [031125-FACRL-IA-12] emphasize through their analyses that if an advertisement is fully created and in existence prior to the transaction—and the U.S. person’s role is limited to its simple dissemination rather than its creation, enhancement, or the provision of additional marketing and business consulting services—then it qualifies for the exemption under the informational materials provision (sometimes linked to the Berman Amendment or comparable language in various sanctions programs).\n\nIn summary, if a U.S. person broadcasts an advertisement exactly as provided by the sanctioned person, with no creative modification or additional services intended to “market” or target audiences on behalf of the sanctioned party, it is likely exempt and does not require a specific OFAC license. However, if any element of the service goes beyond the mere dissemination of pre-existing materials—for instance, if there is substantive alteration or if the U.S. person provides additional marketing or consulting services—then the activity would fall outside the exemption and likely require OFAC authorization.\n\nThus, as long as the advertisement is pre-existing, copy-ready, and the broadcast function is limited to mere dissemination, it would be permitted under OFAC rules."
