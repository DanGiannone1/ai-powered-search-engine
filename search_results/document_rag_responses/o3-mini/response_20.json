Shahmaghsoudi, School of Islamic Sufism c/o NIA Law Group I 7043 Veptura Boulevard Encino, CA 91316 Attn [       ]  Dear [         ]  This responds to your letters of August 30, 2011, and September 15, 2011, to the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"), on behalf of M.T.O. Shahmaghsoudi, School of Islamic Sufism (\"M.T.O.\"), requesting confirmation on authorization from OFAC is required for M.T.O. to import one Sufi sculpture, the Pialeh (the \"Sculpture\"), from Iran into the United States. You indicate in your letters that you understand the sculpture to be classified under chapter subheading 9703 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (\"HTS\").  The Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560,the \"ITR\"), generally prohibit the importation into the United States of any goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. ITR, § 560.201. Additionally, the ITR generally prohibit U.S. persons, wherever located, from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to goods or services Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran) ITR, § 560.206(a). This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing. ITR, § 560.206(b). However, the prohibitions in the ITR do not apply to the importation from any country of information and informational materials. ITR, § 560.210(c). The term \"information and informational materials\" is defined in § 560.315 of the ITR to include certain artworks. To be considered information and informational materials, artworks must be classified under chapter subheading 9701, 9702 or 9703 of the HTS, ITR § 560.315(a)(2). Also, to quality for the information and information materials exemption artworks must be fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions. ITR, § 560.210(c)(2).  Provided the requirements set forth above are met, the exemption for the importation of information and informational materials from Iran would apply to the transaction described in your letter. You should, however, consult the HTS to confirm that the item you intend to import is classified under chapter 9701, 9702 or 9703.  If you have any additional questions about the ITSR or about the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, you may refer to our web site at www.treas.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.

Three Burmese Statues  Opinion  CASE NO. 3:07-cv-250-RJC.  June 24, 2008  ROBERT CONRAD JR., District Judge  THIS MATTER is before the Court on the motion of Plaintiff United States of America for Summary Judgment and Final Order of Forfeiture pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56 and 58, as well as 19 U.S.C. § 1595a(c). (Doc. No. 12). Claimant Ronald C. Morgan filed a response in opposition to the motion. (Doc. No. 13). For the reasons stated below, the Court will GRANT the Motion for Summary Judgment and Final Order of Forfeiture.  I. BACKGROUND  The United States filed a Verified Complaint for Forfeiture In Rem on June 29, 2007, seeking forfeiture of all right, title and interest in three statues purchased by Claimant during a trip to Thailand in November of 2005. (Doc. No. 1). The Complaint alleges that the three statues are products of Burma and presently in violation of federal law, which prohibits the importation of any article that is a product of Burma. See Burmese Freedom Democracy Act of 2003, Pub.L. No. 108-61, 117 Stat. 864; 31 C.F.R. § 537.203.  Claimant maintains that the statues are not in violation of federal law because he purchased the statues from vendors in Thailand on November 4, 2005, and has provided receipts of these transactions. Upon purchase, he arranged for their shipment to Charlotte, North Carolina.  (Doc. No. 13-2: Claimant's Pet. at 1). In January of 2006, Claimant went to the Customs and Border Protection Port Office to claim his merchandise. The statues were described as works of art and collectors items. (Doc. No. 13-4: Haines Aff. ¶ 6). The Customs officer who met Claimant at the office asked an import specialist to further investigate the statues. (Id. at ¶ 8). This specialist, as well as a specialist from the Mint Museum in Charlotte, concluded that the statues were from Burma and possibly in violation of the Burmese embargo. (Id.). Photographs of the statues were sent to the Department of State for further analysis, where they were forwarded to Sylvia Fraser-Lu, a noted scholar of Burmese art, who also concluded that the statues were of Burmese origin and that they were not made in Thailand. (Id. at ¶¶ 9-10).  Upon further investigation of the vendors, undercover agents from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Thailand found that the vendors were aware of laws barring Burmese goods from entering the United States, but were able to avoid legal issues by having the freight forwarders produce documents to conceal the true origin of such items. (Id. at ¶¶ 19, 23).  Because of the questionable origin of the statues and the dates of purchase and import into the country, the United States finds the items subject to seizure and filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and Final Order of Forfeiture pursuant to this claim on March 20, 2008. (Doc. No. 12). Claimant filed a Response to the Motion for Summary Judgment on May 6, 2008. (Doc. No. 13). Though the initial Response did not appear timely, the United States filed a Reply to the Claimant's Response to United States's Motion for Summary Judgment on May 14, 2008. (Doc. No. 14).  [...]  III. CONCLUSION  Since the government has provided uncontradicted evidence that the purchase and sale of these statues occurred after the respective restricted dates and that the statues did originate in and are \"products of\" Burma, the government has satisfied its burden of proof. By failing to offer evidence regarding the origin of the statues, Claimant has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that forfeiture is inappropriate and has not set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact.  IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED that the United States' Motion for Summary Judgment and Final Order of Forfeiture is GRANTED.\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) In United States v. Three Burmese Statues a federal district court upholds the government's seizure and civil forfeiture of three original statutes imported by a U.S. person from Thailand. The statutes were products of Burma. The Burmese Sanctions Regulations, as they existed just prior to the importation, can be found at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2006-title31-vol3/xml/CFR-2006-title31-vol3-part537.xml. Burma was, at the time, subject to a comprehensive import ban that covered all articles of Burmese origin, with very limited exceptions.   The case is notable for the fact that, throughout the proceedings, neither CBP, the DOJ, the claimant (whose property was confiscated) or the court realized that the importation of the statutes was generally licensed by 537.515, which provided that \"importation of information or informational materials that are products of Burma and all transactions directly incident to such importation are authorized,\" and where 537.308, the standard definitional provision defining \"Information or informational materials,\" included \"artworks\" classified under chapter heading 9703 of the USHTS. (In this case, the government itself stated that the classification was 9703 - see p. 13 of the native PDF). Heading 9703 covers \"[o]riginal sculptures and statuary, in any material.\"  Compare Case No. IA-17159 (sculpture to be classified under chapter subheading 9703 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\" as exempt \"informational materials\"). Neither the forfeiture complaint, the claimant’s response, nor any other item in the docket treat the \"informational materials\" argument. The lesson, of which this is not the only instructive case, is that components of the government apart from OFAC cannot always be counted on to grasp the nuance of sanctions laws. On its face, the \"informational materials\" exemption leaves open the possibility that original statuary classified 9703 qualifies as exempt \"artwork\", but the particular question of sculptures and other original statuary is not directly addressed in the regulations (or, apparently, OFAC's other public guidance, but see again Case No. IA-17159).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

As a U.S. person, am I prohibited from engaging in transactions involving information or informational materials, including artwork, that are the property or subject to an interest in property of persons designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) under or otherwise blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13224, as amended, (E.O. 13224)?  Yes. In general, any transaction or dealing by a U.S. person in any property or interests in property of persons designated as SDGTs under or otherwise blocked pursuant to E.O. 13224 is prohibited. Such property includes artwork and other information and information materials. Certain exemptions available under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) relating to personal communications, humanitarian donations, information or informational materials, and travel do not apply to transactions with SDGTs or persons otherwise blocked pursuant to E.O. 13224.  For purposes of these prohibitions, U.S. persons include all U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens regardless of where they are located, all persons and entities within the United States, and all U.S.-incorporated entities and their foreign branches. U.S. persons who engage in prohibited transactions with SDGTs or with persons otherwise blocked pursuant to E.O. 13224 may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.  Non-U.S. persons who engage in prohibited transactions or dealings subject to U.S. jurisdiction with SDGTs or with persons otherwise blocked pursuant to E.O. 13224 may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, and may also risk being sanctioned by OFAC. Foreign financial institutions may also be subject to correspondent and payable through account sanctions if they knowingly facilitate significant transactions for or on behalf of an SDGT. [12-13-2019]\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) FAQs 812-814 were issued simultaneously in connection with the designation of a prominent art dealer. See \"Treasury Designates Prominent Lebanon and DRC-Based Hizballah Money Launderers.\" [1]  The primary purpose of this FAQ is to confirm, as have others (see e.g. FAQ # 534), that the \"informational materials\" exemption does not apply to the GTSR. Artworks, including ancient artworks, generally meet the definition of \"informational materials.\" See e.g. 510.312 (Information or informational materials); CROSS Customs Ruling NY E89509 (1999).  Accordingly, secondary sanctions could also be imposed on non-U.S. persons dealing in artworks in which SDGTs have an interest, given that EO 13886 amends EO 13224 to allow for the imposition of secondary sanctions on non-U.S. persons dealing with SDGTs. OFAC appears to generally consider activities not to be secondarily sanctionable to the degree that the activities would be exempt from regulation under all applicable primary sanctions programs. See General Note on Secondary Sanctions and “Derivative Designation” Criteria; Identification of the Gap Between the Theoretical and Practical Scopes of Authorities Targeting Transactions with no U.S. Nexus; Enforcement Risk Management (System Ed. Note). But in this case, U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing in informational materials in which SDGTs have an interest.

  "answer": "According to [31 CFR § 579.305 - Information or informational materials], the term “information or informational materials” includes artworks—but only if they are classified under heading 9701, 9702, or 9703 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. In this regulatory context, sculptures can indeed qualify as informational materials if they are classified under heading 9703 (which covers original sculptures and statuary).\n\nAdditionally, [Case No. IA-17159] confirms that certain sculptures, such as a Sufi sculpture, are treated as informational materials when they are classified under chapter subheading 9703. The commentary in that document even discusses that sculptures falling under heading 9703 generally qualify for the informational materials exemption, reinforcing the idea that sculptures meet the definition so long as they are appropriately classified.\n\nThus, if a sculpture is an artwork and is classified under heading 9703 of the HTS, it is considered informational material under these U.S. regulations."
