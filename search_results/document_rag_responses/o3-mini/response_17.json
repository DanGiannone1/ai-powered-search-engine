Suite 300 Washington, D.C. 20007   Dear Mr. [    ]:  This responds to your request dated May 23, 2018, and supplemental correspondence dated May 31, 2018 and June 5, 2018 (the \"Application\"), on behalf of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), seeking interpretive guidance on the transportation of the Swedish and Danish national teams and their supporters to various airports in Russia for the 2018 World Cup. According to the Application, SAS intends to operate 12 charter flights to Russian airports shortly before and during the World Cup. You indicate that 8 of the 12 charter flights will be landing at airports that are managed and/or operated by Russian entities, specifically Basel Aero and Airports of Regions, that are 50 percent or more owned by Basic Element or the Renova Group, entities designated on April 6, 2018 under the Ukraine-Related Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 589 (URSR) (these airports will be referred to as the \"SDN-Related Airports\").   According to the Application, SAS will be obligated to pay landing fees and ground handling payments to the SDN-Related Airports in Euros or Rubles in the approximate equivalent amount of USD 3,500 with an estimated total payments of under USD 30,000. You further state that, with one exception, contracts for the charter flights were entered into with the national soccer teams and/or team fan support organizations prior to April 6, 2018. Finally, according to the Application, no U.S. financial institutions will be involved in the transactions and no SAS employee or contractor operating on the charter flights will be a U.S. person. SAS seeks clarification that payments for landing fees and other airport services to the SDN-Related Airports, as described in the Application, would not be considered a \"material violation\" or a significant transaction under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).   The URSR prohibit all transactions prohibited pursuant to Executive Order 13660 of March 6, 2014 (E.O. 13660), Executive Order 13661 of March 16, 2014 (E.O. 13661), and Executive Order 13662 of March 20, 2014 (E.O. 13662). Basic Element was designated pursuant to E.O.s 13661 and 13662 while the Renova Group was designated pursuant to E.O. 13662; accordingly, all of Basic Element and the Renova Group's property and interests in property that are in the United States or in the possession or control of a U.S. person are blocked. Property blocked pursuant to an Executive order or regulations administered by OFAC is broadly defined to include any property or interest in property, tangible or intangible, including present, future or contingent interests. URSR, § 589.308. A property interest subject to blocking includes interests of any nature whatsoever, direct or indirect. URSR, § 589.304.   Please also be aware that persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to an Executive order or regulations administered by OFAC (\"blocked persons\") are considered to have an interest in all property and interests in property of an entity in which such blocked persons own, whether individually or in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. Consequently, any entity owned in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons is itself considered to be a blocked person. The property and interests in property of such an entity are blocked regardless of whether the entity itself is listed in the annex to an Executive order or otherwise placed on OFAC's list of Specially Designated Nationals (\"SDN List\"). Please see OFAC's \"Revised Guidance on Entities Owned by Persons whose Property and interests in Property are Blocked\" at http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/documents /licensing_guidance.pdf.   On August 2, 2017, the President signed CAATSA into law. Section 226 of CAATSA amends section 5 of the Ukraine Freedom Support Act (UFSA) by requiring the imposition of sanctions on foreign financial institutions if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that they, inter alia, knowingly facilitated significant financial transactions on behalf of any Russian person added to OFAC's SDN List pursuant to UFSA, E.O. 13660, E.O. 13661, E.O. 13662, or any other E.O. addressing the crisis in Ukraine. Section 228 of CAATSA amends the Support for the Sovereignty, integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 (SSIDES) and adds further mandatory sanctions, including with respect to a foreign person that the President determines knowingly, on or after the date of the enactment of CAATSA, facilitates a significant transaction or transactions, including deceptive or structured transactions, for or on behalf of any person subject to sanctions imposed by the United States with respect to the Russian Federation. OFAC will consider the totality of the facts and circumstances when determining whether transactions are \"significant.\" Please see the Ukraine / Russia-related Sanctions page on OFAC's website for more details, including Frequently Asked Questions Nos. 542, 545, and 574, at https://www.treasury.gov/resource- center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/ukraine.aspx.   The URSR does not prohibit a third-country party from operating charter flights to the SDN-Related Airports or from paying associated landings fees and ground handling payments in non-U.S. dollar denominated funds, so long as the transfer does not involve the U.S. financial system and does not otherwise involve U.S. persons. Based on the information provided in your Application, it does not appear that operating charter flights to the SDN-Related Airports or paying associated non-U.S. dollar denominated fees would be prohibited by the URSR. However, we are unable to opine if the proposed transactions include any potentially sanctionable activity, under specific sanctions criteria established in UFSA and SSIDES as amended under CAATSA.   If you have any further questions regarding the Ukraine-related sanctions program, please contact OFAC's Licensing Division at (202) 622-2480. Additional information about U.S. sanctions programs may be found on OFAC's website at www.treasury.gov/ofac.  Sincerely,  June 18, 2018  Assistant Director for Licensing  Office of Foreign Assets Control \n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) The 2018 FIFA World Cup (soccer) was held in Russia, and a number of the key host city airports were \"managed and/or operated by Russian entities, specifically Basel Aero and Airports of Regions, that are 50 percent or more owned by Basic Element or the Renova Group, entities\". See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airports_of_Regions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi_International_Airport  The applicant non-US person airline was seeking guidance on the sanctionability and/or prohibited nature of \"pay[ing] landing fees and ground handling payments to the SDN-Related Airports in Euros or Rubles in the approximate equivalent amount of USD 3,500 with an estimated total payments of under USD 30,000\". The applicant appears to have represented that the transaction would have no U.S. nexus (\"no U.S. financial institutions will be involved in the transactions and no SAS employee or contractor operating on the charter flights will be a U.S. person\").  As OFAC notes, sections 5 of UFSA and 10 of SSIDES, as amended by CAATSA, make sanctionable certain \"significant transaction or transactions...for or on behalf of any person subject to sanctions imposed by the United States with respect to the Russian Federation,\" were \"OFAC will consider the totality of the facts and circumstances when determining whether transactions are \"significant\".  OFAC's conclusion here is that the proposed activities are not prohibited by the URSR \"so long as the transfer does not involve the U.S. financial system and does not otherwise involve U.S. persons,\" and OFAC refuses/declines to \"opine [on whether] the proposed transactions include any potentially sanctionable activity, under specific sanctions criteria established in UFSA and SSIDES as amended under CAATSA.\"  (i) The Secondary Sanctions Conclusion  Query: would \"estimated total payments of under USD 30,000\" most of which represent payments for \"contracts for...charter flights were entered into with the national soccer teams and/or team fan support organizations prior to April 6, 2018\" realistically be regarded as a \"significant\" transaction, as defined at 589.413? As of 11-21-23, there has not been a single instance of a secondary sanctions enforcement action based on facts such as these, in terms of the value of the transctions and the circumstances, but OFAC conclusion here is consistent with OFAC's general posture toward giving guidance on whether a given transaction would be regarded as \"significant\" for secondary sanctions purpose. More specifically, OFAC appears to simply refuse to do so, at least in the context of interpretive guidance requests made to the licensing division. Compare Case No. UKRAINE-EO13661-2015-317467-1 (also URSR) and  Case No. IFSR-2014-314645-1, both using the \"unable to opine\" construction in response to a guidance request focusing on sanctionability under \"significant transaction\"-based secondary sanctions provisions. Compare also Case No. IA-2018-357507-1 (Alitalia).   (ii) The Primary Sanctions Conclusion; Travel Exemption  OFAC says that the proposed activities are not prohibited by the URSR \"so long as the transfer [of funds] does not involve the U.S. financial system and does not otherwise involve U.S. persons.\" The implication is that if the transfer did involve the U.S. financial system, it would be prohibited. OFAC has recognized that the IEEPA travel exemption applies to the URSR (see FAQ # 504). The applicant here does not request guidance on the applicability of the travel exemption, which would have solved both the potential primary sanctions issue as well as the secondary sanctions issue (see FAQ # 545: \"a transaction is not significant if U.S. persons would not require specific licenses from OFAC to participate in it.\")   To the extent that we can presume that OFAC would have taken it upon itself to tell the applicant that the travel exemption applied if OFAC was of that view, this constitutes a notable interpretation of the travel exemption. See Notable Examples Illustrating the Scope of the Travel Exemption. If this were a charter flight full of tourists, there is a chance the result would have been different.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Are payments or the facilitation of payments not involving U.S. persons to Iranian civil aviation authorities for overflights of Iran or landing in Iran by aircraft that are owned by a non-U.S. person and registered outside the United States sanctionable under U.S. law?  No.  Provided that the relevant transactions do not involve the U.S. financial system or persons on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), payments of charges for services rendered by the Government of Iran in connection with the overflight of Iran or landing in Iran of aircraft owned by a non-U.S. person and registered outside the United States are not subject to sanctions under U.S. law.  The involvement of persons on the SDN List, including Iranian financial institutions or airlines designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224 or Executive Order 13382, would create sanctions exposure for participants to such transactions.  U.S. persons and U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities cannot participate in transactions related to the payment of overflight or landing fees to the Government of Iran, nor can such transactions transit the U.S. financial system, unless the transactions fall within the scope of 31 C.F.R. § 560.522 or a specific license issued by OFAC and the payments in connection with such authorized transactions are consistent with 31 C.F.R. § 560.516.   [11-05-2018]\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:   1) THE FAQ AS IT RELATES TO SECONDARY SANCTIONS  The first paragraph of this FAQ appears to address the relationship between overflight payments and the secondary sanctions in effect during the JCPOA period and thereafter.  OFAC says that \"involvement of persons on the SDN List, including Iranian financial institutions or airlines designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224 [NPWMD] or Executive Order 13382 [SDGT] would create sanctions exposure for participants to such transactions.\" This is a description of the Iran secondary sanctions architecture as a whole, with CISADA and the IFSR sections implementing CISASA (561.201) containing no carveout for transactions involving NPWMD or SDGT banks, even for humanitarian-related transactions.   Note, however, that no secondary sanctions authorities secondarily sanction transactions solely because they involve an Iranian financial institution blocked solely pursuant to EO 13599, even if that entity appears on the SDN list. See, e.g. IFCA Section 1244(c)(2)(C)(iii), Sec. 1(a)(iii) and (iv) of EO 13846, which are the broadest secondary sanctions authorities, and all of which carve out transactions involving such entities. As of 5/2019, the SDN list includes Iranian financial institutions blocked solely pursuant to EO 13599. Therefore, the second paragraph of this FAQ, to the degree that it appears to encompass all Iranian SDNs, is simply incorrect. That language was carried over from a 2016 version of this FAQ [1], which was written at a time when Iranian financial institutions blocked solely pursuant to EO 13599 were still blocked but were, pursuant to the JCPOA, left off of the SDN list.   2) As it relates to secondary sanctions, note that this is not a statement concerning landing in or overflights of Iran as a special category of transactions not within the scope of the secondary sanctions authorities. It is, rather, a statement that could have been made about any activity not otherwise within the scope of secondary sanctions authorities, including, for example, the sale of bicycles to Iran pursuant to a transaction with no U.S. nexus. Even though it is arguably the case that OFAC would not secondarily sanction a non-U.S. person for engaging in activity in which a U.S. person could engage in, neither the \"Berman Amendment\" exemption for travel (IEEPA Sec. 1702(b)(4) nor 560.522 of the ITSR (Allowable payments for overflights of Iranian airspace) have any bearing on the substance of the FAQ.   3) THE FAQ AS IT RELATES TO PRIMARY SANCTIONS  If not evident enough from the existence of 560.522, the second paragraph of the FAQ confirms that payments for landing overflight or landing fees to the Government of Iran are not within the scope of the travel exemption (560.210(d)).   Note that the structure of 560.522 makes it particularly difficult to apply to U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities subject to the ITSR solely as a result of 560.215. Those entities can engage in activities authorized by ITSR GLs \"that would be authorized by a general license set forth in or issued pursuant [the ITSR] if engaged in by a U.S. person or in the United States...only to the same extent as the U.S. person is authorized to engage in the transaction and subject to all the conditions and requirements set forth in the general license for the U.S. person.\" (560.556). 560.522 provides that \"[p]ayments to Iran of charges for services rendered by the Government of Iran in connection with the overflight of Iran or emergency landing in Iran of aircraft owned by a United States person or registered in the United States are authorized.\" May the Dutch subsidiary of a U.S. company pay the GOI for overflights related to an aircraft owned by a Dutch person and/or registered in the Netherlands? If the purpose of 560.556 is to put U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities on the same footing as U.S. persons with respect to trade with Iran, then yes, obviously, but this example illustrates the difficulties in applying 560.556. On its face, 560.556 calls for the U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entity to \"reimagine\" only the non-U.S. person status of the foreign entity subject to the ITSR and/or the location of the transaction. Here, for the GL to have any effect for 560.215 entities, applying 560.556 would require \"reimagining\" the owner and/or registration of the aircraft. See General Note on Sanctions Provisions for which Determining Applicability Requires \"Counterfactual\" Analysis of Transactions (System Ed. Note).  4) Concerning the applicability of sanctions regulations to vessels and aircraft on the basis of their registration and/or operational control by U.S. persons, see General Note on OFAC’s Assertion of Worldwide Jurisdiction over non-U.S. Origin Vessels and Aircraft with Certain Relationships to the United States (System Ed. Note).  5) Is the last paragraph of this FAQ necessarily true? Compare Case No. IA-12784 (overflights authorized by the \"official business\" GL at 560.539).  ----  [1] 417. Are payments or the facilitation of payments not involving U.S. persons to Iranian civil aviation authorities for overflights of Iran or landing in Iran by aircraft that are owned by a non-U.S. person and registered outside the United States sanctionable under U.S. law?  No. Provided that the relevant transactions do not involve the U.S. financial system or persons on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), payments of charges for services rendered by the Government of Iran in connection with the overflight of Iran or landing in Iran of aircraft owned by a non-U.S. person and registered outside the United States are not subject to sanctions under U.S. law. The involvement of persons on the SDN List, including Iranian financial institutions or airlines designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224 or Executive Order 13382, would create sanctions exposure for participants to such transactions.  U.S. persons cannot participate in transactions related to the payment of overflight or landing fees to the Government of Iran, nor can such transactions transit the U.S. financial system, unless the transactions fall within the scope of 31 C.F.R. § 560.522 or a specific license issued by OFAC and the payments in connection with such authorized transactions are consistent with 31 C.F.R. § 560.516. U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities are authorized to participate in transactions related to the payment of overflight or landing fees to the Government of Iran to the extent such transactions are consistent with the terms of General License H.

Iran: Travel Exemption\n=== END TITLE ===\n\n=== DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n031125-FACRL-IA-12 November 25, 2003  IRAN: TRAVEL EXEMPTION FAC No. [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  Dear [text deleted]:    This is with regard to your letters of January 9, 2003, June 6, 2003, and June 12, 2003 to the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") on behalf of [a U.S. person]. In your letters you inquired whether the travel exemption provisions contained in § 560.210(d) of the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the \"Regulations\"), authorize [U.S. persons] to engage in the following activities involving the arrangement of air travel between the United States and Iran:  1)  Publication of schedules of flights between Europe and Iran; 2)  Publication of interline airfares; 3)  Acceptance of reservations for travel between the United States and Iran; 4)  Issuance of airline tickets for the entire trip between the United States and Iran; and 5)  Advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran.  Section 560.204 of the Regulations prohibits the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, technology, or services to Iran or the Government of Iran. However, § 560.210(c) of the Regulations provides that the prohibitions do not apply to the importation from and the exportation to any country of information and informational materials fully created and in existence at the time of the transaction.In addition, § 560.210(d) of the Regulations provides that the prohibitions contained in § 560.204 do not apply to transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, including importation of accompanied baggage for personal use, maintenance within any country including payment of living expenses and acquisition of goods or services for personal use, and arrangement or facilitation of such travel including nonscheduled air, sea, or land voyages. Section 560.210(d) of the Regulations further provides that the exemption extends to transactions with Iranian carriers and those involving group tours and payments in Iran made for transactions directly incident to travel.   Based upon the information submitted, we have concluded that, with the exceptions noted below, the exemptions set forth in § 560.210 (c and d) of the Regulations are applicable to all of the above listed activities involving airline travel between the United States and Iran.  With respect to the advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran, the Regulations do not prohibit such transactions unless they are undertaken at the behest of a person in Iran or an Iranian entity. The Regulations would prohibit advertising-related transactions undertaken at the behest of a person or entity in Iran, unless the information or informational materials exemption applies. To fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption, such transactions must be limited to the direct dissemination of copy-ready materials. A U.S. person cannot provide any other related services to Iran, such as the development of advertising materials or an advertising campaign or serving as an agent for the buying or brokering of advertising space, without OFAC authorization. Such activities do not fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption. Such activities also would not fall within the scope of the travel exemption, as they are not directly incident to travel.  Although the travel exemption set forth in § 560.210(d) of the Regulations applies regardless of whether the connecting carrier is Iran Air or another Iranian air carrier, it applies only to arranging travel and should not be construed to authorize transactions not directly incident to travel, such as the creation or enhancement of a travel reservation service in Iran. Further, while [U.S. persons] are authorized to accept reservations, issue tickets for travel on Iranian carriers, and advertise air service between the United States and Iran (subject to the caveats referenced above), any U.S. origin financial services used to exchange payments with Iran must fall within the scope of the authorizations set forth in § 560.516 of the Regulations, which necessitate the use of non-U.S., non-Iranian financial institutions as intermediaries to such transactions.  If you have any additional questions about the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, you may refer to our web site at www.treas.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.   Sincerely,   [Signature]  R. Richard Newcomb Director Office of Foreign Assets Control    \n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) The Guidance analyzes a set of transactions at the intersection of the Berman Amendment exemptions for travel and transactions ordinarily incident thereto (560.210(d)) and the exemption for informational materials transactions (560.210(c)).   With regard to OFAC's declaration that \"the Regulations do not prohibit [the advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran] unless they are undertaken at the behest of a person in Iran or an Iranian entity,\" compare FAC No. CU-156123, considering a Cuban travel company paying a U.S. person to broadcast advertising as being within the scope of informational materials exemption (i.e. where the travel exemption was not available). The reason why the advertising generally is not permitted is because OFAC deems it i) not ordinarily incident to travel, and ii) more of a service than a transaction incident to the import/export of informational materials, but when the advertising transaction only involves the dissemination of pre-existing materials, it is exempt. [1] As confirmed by FAC No. CU-156123, \"copy ready\" does not imply that qualifying materials cannot be in audio/visual format.   2) Other guidance clarifies OFAC's positions on the publication of fares and acceptance of reservations (FACRL-CU-01 2002), acting as a travel agent (Case No. IA-17270) and dealing with an entity designated pursuant to a sanctions program with a travel exemption (Case No. IA-16194). See also our discussion on SEC filings describing activities done by companies purporting to act under the Berman Amendment exemptions for travel.   Compare Case No. IA-17270 with the statement that \"the creation or enhancement of a travel reservation service in Iran\" is prohibited.  Case No. IA-17270, issued 10 years after the publication of this guidance, seems to stand for the proposition that doing more than simply accepting reservations is exempt, at least in connection with Iranians traveling to the U.S.  3) Guidance should apply generally to all IEEPA-based programs with a travel exemption. With respect to Cuba, a combination of the informational materials exemption of the CACR combined with current general licenses related to travel will have much the same result, but not in all cases.    4) See Delta Air Lines, Inc., Correspondence with the SEC Office of Global Security Risk (2007): sale of tickets pursuant to codeshare agreements considered exempt when the tickets involve travel to sanctioned destinations other than Cuba.  [1] Refer to section 2(I) of the \"Ordinarily Incident\" System Note; comment to Case No. IA-2012-299245-1.  5) See Iran-Related Civil Aviation Industry Advisory (2019), and comments thereto, concerning the relationship between primary and secondary sanctions in the aviation industry.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

If overflights themselves were exempt, payments for overflights would also be exempt. See Civil Enforcement Information - Spirit Airlines, Inc (2008) for overflight-related enforcement action. The same is true of air ambulance services. What the GL does not clarify, however, is whether overflights of a sanctioned destination are necessarily within the scope of OFAC's jurisdiction to begin with, presuming that no \"services\" are received in connection with the overflight.  3) [RESERVED]  3) The scope of this GL is somewhat confusing on the question of transactions ancillary to underlying transactions not subject to the sanctions regulations.   May a U.S. person parent airline \"approve\" (i.e. facilitate) an overflight payment of a non-U.S. person subsidiary within the scope of this license where the aircraft has nothing to do with the U.S.? It depends on whether the \"aircraft [being] registered in the United States or owned or controlled by, or chartered to, persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction\" contains any conditions for use of the license. Facilitation of a transaction by a foreign person in which a U.S. person could engage directly is not \"prohibited facilitation,\" but it is not clear whether the aircraft actually being connected to the U.S. is a condition of the GL or merely a set of conditions that would allow OFAC to assert jurisdiction over the transaction in the first place. The latter seems more likely, but this GL is irregular. See General Note on Sanctions Provisions for which Determining Applicability Requires \"Counterfactual\" Analysis of Transactions (System Ed. Note).  4) Concerning the applicability of sanctions regulations to vessels and aircraft on the basis of their registration and/or operational control by U.S. persons, see General Note on OFAC’s Assertion of Worldwide Jurisdiction over non-U.S. Origin Vessels and Aircraft with Certain Relationships to the United States (System Ed.

The prohibitions contained in §576.201(a)(3) do not apply to any postal, telegraphic, telephonic, or other personal communication that does not involve the transfer of anything of value. (b) Information or informational materials. (1) The importation from any country and the exportation to any country of any information or informational materials, as defined in §576.306, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium of transmission, are exempt from the prohibitions of §576.201(a)(3). (2) This section does not exempt from regulation or authorize transactions related to information or informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services. Such prohibited transactions include, but are not limited to, payment of advances for information or informational materials not yet created and completed (with the exception of prepaid subscriptions for widely circulated magazines and other periodical publications); provision of services to market, produce or co-produce, create, or assist in the creation of information or informational materials; and, with respect to information or informational materials imported from persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to §576.201(a)(3), payment of royalties with respect to income received for enhancements or alterations made by U.S. persons to such information or informational materials. (3) This section does not exempt or authorize transactions incident to the exportation of software subject to the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730-774, or to the exportation of goods, technology, or software for use in the transmission of any data, or to the provision, sale, or leasing of capacity on telecommunications transmission facilities (such as satellite or terrestrial network connectivity) for use in the transmission of any data. The exportation of such items or services and the provision, sale, or leasing of such capacity or facilities to a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to §576.201(a) are prohibited. (c) Travel. The prohibitions contained in §576.201(a)(3) do not apply to any transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, including importation of accompanied baggage for personal use, maintenance within any country including payment of living expenses and acquisition of goods or services for personal use, and arrangement or facilitation of such travel including nonscheduled air, sea, or land voyages.\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) This is a standard \"Exempt transactions\" provision for an IEEPA, list-based blocking program. On its face, it applies only to transactions otherwise prohibited by 576.201(a)(3), which implements a standard, IEEPA-based, list-based blocking order. It should be noted, however, that there is now reason to believe that the IEEPA exemptions would apply even to persons blocked pursuant to 576.201(a)(1)-(2), to the degree that they do not appear on or are related to persons appearing on any UN-administered sanctions list. Refer to General Note on the Applicability of IEEPA/TWEA Exemptions in EOs and Sanctions Regulations not Specifically Mentioning Them (System Ed. Note). This is also discussed in General Note on the Iraq Stabilization and Insurgency Sanctions Regulations and the Relationship Between the Authorities Underlying the Regulations (System Ed. Note). See 576.207 for a special non IEEPA-based exemption for property controlled by the military forces of the United States and their coalition partners in Iraq.  2) INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS  The scope of the informational materials exemption of the sort found here has been interpreted identically across programs. The Research System contains over 100 guidance letters, interpretive rulings, FAQs and other documents addressing the various interpretive issues that have come up with regard to the exemption. Refer to, e.g. Examples of the \"Substantive or Artistic Alteration or Enhancement\" and \"Fully Created and in Existence\" Standards, Notes Common to the \"Information or informational materials\" Definitional Provision, Notable Applications of the Definition of \"Information or Informational Materials\" and Examples of Transactions Exempt as Incident to Underlying Informational Materials Transactions.  3) TRAVEL   a) The scope of the exemption for travel and transactions ordinarily incident thereto been interpreted identically across programs. The Research System contains a multitude of guidance letters, interpretive rulings, FAQs and other documents addressing the various interpretive issues that have come up with regard to the exemption. See Notable Examples Illustrating the scope of the travel Exemption.  4) PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS  The Personal Communications exemption is common across programs, and interpretations of it can be found in the Research System by selecting the \"Key Legal Issues\" search criterion associated with the personal communications exemption. [12-23-23 UPDATE - See Case No. IA-2017-339679-1 (certain \"mentoring\" services provided by a non-profit over the internet through social media are exempt under the IEEPA \"personal communications\" exemption)].   5) DONATIONS/HUMANITARIAN  Some \"Exempt transactions\" provisions allow for transactions of this type. In this case, the President invoked the authority, granted under IEEPA, to decline to apply the exemption for donations.  6) TRANSACTIONS ORDINARILY INCIDENT TO EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS, GENERALLY  To the degree that a transaction is exempt from regulation as a result of an IEEPA-mandated exemption (i.e. personal communications, informational materials, travel, (and sometimes donations)), all transactions incident to the exempt transactions are also, themselves, exempt. See Notes Common to the 400-Level Interpretive Provisions Authorizing Transactions \"Ordinarily Incident\" to a Licensed Transaction; Transactions Incident to Others in General (System Ed. Note). This is true whether or not the underlying transaction involves a U.S. person. See General Note and Associated Matrix Pertaining to U.S. Person Engagement in Transactions Incident to Transactions by Foreign Persons (System Ed. Note).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Examples Related to the Making and Processing of Payments for Underlying Transactions Within the Scope of the Exemption  i)  Arranging for a funds transfer (and presumably a U.S. person bank processing the funds transfer) of any amount to reimburse a person ordinarily resident in Iran for travel from Iran to a third country (travel, hotel and food expenses), where the context of the reimbursement is that it represents a \"stipend as a prize\" awardee to the sanctioned person (Case No. IA-8039, Case No. IA-6489). Payments in support of U.S. persons to travel to sanctioned countries to engage in otherwise non-prohibited activity; payments in support of sanctioned persons to travel to the U.S. to engage in activities that were generally licensed (Case No. SU-3797-1). See also Case No. IA-2014-308303-1. ii)  U.S. persons may make payments related to travel on, and transactions involving the facilitation of travel on, an airline blocked pursuant to a blocking regulation to which the travel exemption applies (Case No. IA-16194, the airline was blocked pursuant to the WMDPSR (544.201)). iii)  U.S. persons may process payments (credit card or otherwise) related to travel on, and transactions involving the facilitation of travel on, an airline blocked pursuant to a blocking regulation to which the travel exemption applies, even where no parties to the underlying transaction were U.S. persons (Capital One Financial Corporation, Q2 2016 10-Q Filing, the airline was blocked pursuant to the WMDPSR (544.201)). iv)  A U.S. person credit card/payment systems company processing payments for an acquirer on behalf of GSA owned by a blocked airline (blocked at the time pursuant to the WMDPSR), where the transactions processed were/are apparently limited to international travel transactions that qualify for the travel exemption, and where no U.S. persons need be involved with the underlying transactions processed (Mastercard Incorporated, 2016; 2018; 2019 10-K Filings). v)  Foreign branches of a U.S. person bank (that are therefore U.S. persons themselves) can process funds transfers—in both an intermediary and remitting bank capacity—in connection with visa fees paid to third-country Iranian embassies in connection with exempt travel to Iran (presumably not involving U.S. persons) (JPMorgan Chase & Co., 2012 10-K Filing). vi)  U.S. persons may NOT process payments (net settlement payments in connection with activity some of which are exempt and some of which not) involving \"cargo-related transactions\" that are outside the scope of the travel exemption (Civil Enforcement Information - JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (2nd violation, Settlement Agreement Component) (2018). vii)  U.S. banks exporting financial services to Iran by maintaining (and allowing access to) accounts of U.S. persons traveling in Iran (OFAC FAQ (Current) # 118; Case No. IA-16053; Ukraine General License Number 7 (a contrario)) (this is either exempt because of the travel exemption or outside the scope of the ITSR's prohibitions altogether). viii)  Pay and process payments related to the claims made under the provision of any authorized or exempt insurance policy (FAQ # 778, presumes \"ordinarily incident\" insurance policies are not treated more favorable than exempt insurance policies). ix)  [EXEMPT] U.S. banks allowing a U.S. person \"traveling to Iran\" but not \"ordinarily resident\" in Iran to \"conduct certain transactions, including electronic bill payments to U.S. parties, electronic transfers of funds between [] U.S. accounts, and deposits by family or friends who are ordinarily resident in the United States\" on behalf of the  U.S. person (this is either exempt because of the travel exemption or outside the scope of the ITSR prohibitions altogether) (Case No. IA-16053). In general, the exportation of services to a person \"in\" (but not \"ordinarily resident in\" a sanctioned destination is exempt if the person is temporarily travelling \"in\" the sanctioned destination.  x)  [NOT EXEMPT] U.S. banks export financial services to U.S. citizens permanently resident in sanctioned countries (State Street Bank and Trust Co.).  xi)  [EXEMPT] Providing a \"fellowship grants…intended to cover or offset all costs related to…including travel, accommodation, and living expenses, for a period between two months and two years…\" (Important note: grants can be provided when \"intended\" to offset travel expenses, even though the funds are provided in advance of travel as a lump-sum payment to a bank account of an Iranian). Case No. IA-2014-308303-1.  xii)  [EXEMPT] \"banking transactions involving foreign currency drafts, travelers’ checks, or other instruments negotiated incident to travel in the United States\" Case No. UKRAINE-EO13661-2014-313653-1.   * Note re: Relationship With 400-level \"Ordinarily Incident\" Interpretive Provision  A transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed (non-exempt) underlying transaction is normally covered under the same authority as the license itself. In IEEPA-based sanctions programs, the relationship between travel and the \"ordinarily incident\" interpretive provision is generally irrelevant, since transactions ordinarily incident to travel are exempt irrespective of whether such travel is in furtherance of an underlying authorized transaction. There is, however, evidence that travel transactions can be authorized as \"ordinarily incident\" to licensed transactions where the license is issued pursuant to a sanctions program to which no travel exemption applies. In such cases, the \"ordinarily incident\" provision may be the only source authority for travel-related transactions (involving travel by U.S. persons, or the facilitation of non-U.S. persons’ travel). See Case No. IQ-2655 and all associated specific licenses, and comments thereto.   * Note on Duration of Qualifying Travel  In Case No. IA-2014-308303-1, OFAC allows that grants to cover \"accommodation, and certain living expenses abroad\" can be exempt when intended for a visit that could last \"for a period between two months and two years\". That transactions incident to travel can cover a period of such length is not clear from any other statement attributable to OFAC issued as of the last update of this note.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Compare 542.211, and comments thereto, and see General Note on the Applicability of IEEPA/TWEA Exemptions in EOs and Sanctions Regulations not Specifically Mentioning Them.  1) INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS  The scope of the informational materials exemption of the sort found here has been interpreted identically across programs.

[12-23-23 UPDATE - See Case No. IA-2017-339679-1 (certain \"mentoring\" services provided by a non-profit over the internet through social media are exempt under the IEEPA \"personal communications\" exemption)].   4) DONATIONS/HUMANITARIAN  584.206(d) of the Magnitsky Act Sanctions Regulation (MASR) is the only \"humanitarian donations\" exemption to appear in a \"list-based\" (i.e. non-embargo) regulatory provision. This is somewhat of an anomaly. Typically, list-based blocking sanctions are issued pursuant to or in conjunction with executive orders that invoke the President’s IEEPA powers pursuant to a \"national emergency\" and in which, as a matter of course, the President exercises his option under IEEPA to exclude the making of donations to sanctioned persons from the from the range of transaction types exempt from regulation.   This is generally true even when the sanctions are imposed pursuant to a specific statute passed by Congress. Compare EO 13818, which declares a national emergency in connection with the implementation of the \"Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act\" and \"opts out\" of donations exemption contained in IEEPA.  In this rare case, however, the MASR were issued directly under the authority of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act (Magnitsky Act), of which Sec. 406(a)(1) grants the President to block persons to the extent permissible under IEEPA but does not account for the donation issue. Here, there was no executive order issued in conjunction with the MASR.  All of this is to say that the \"humanitarian donations\" exemption is in the MASR only exists because the President did not declare a national emergency solely for the purpose of implementing the Magnitsky Act. It is not clear why no executive order implements the Magnitsky Act, but what is almost virtually certain is that the existence of 584.206(d) was an unintended consequence of implementing the Magnitsky Act without the concurrent declaration of a \"national emergency.\" 584.206(d) does not reflect a considered policy preference on the part of the Executive Branch to make \"humanitarian donations\" available to persons sanctioned to the Magnitsky Act, none of which are presumed to be indigent in the first place. In sum, you ought to be 100% sure that any such transactions engaged in under the authority of  584.206(d) are of a sort that qualify for the exemption. In the event that OFAC were made aware of any such transaction, we would expect OFAC to take a close look at it with a particularly skeptical eye.   \"IN GENERAL.—The President shall exercise all powers granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (except that the requirements of section 202 of such Act (50 U.S.C. 1701) shall not apply) to the extent necessary to freeze and prohibit all transactions in all property and interests in property of a person who is on the list required by section 404(a) of this Act if such property and interests in property are in the United States, come within the United States, or are or come within the possession or control of a United States person.\"  5) TRANSACTIONS ORDINARILY INCIDENT TO EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS, GENERALLY  To the degree that a transaction is exempt from regulation as a result of an IEEPA-mandated exemption (i.e. personal communications, informational materials, travel, (and sometimes donations)), all transactions incident to the exempt transactions are also, themselves, exempt.

Hosts) transactions involving Cuba. By extrapolating the results of that sampling review to the total transactions processed by Airbnb Payments between September 28, 2015 and March 1, 2020, it was determined that Airbnb Payments processed payments related to 3,464 extrapolated Stays transactions in Cuba by Airbnb, Inc. “Guests” traveling for reasons outside of OFAC’s 12 authorized categories. Airbnb Payments also processed payments related to 3,076 extrapolated Experiences transactions where Airbnb Payments failed to keep records in accordance with OFAC’s regulations. Airbnb Payments also processed payments related to 44 confirmed transactions involving non-U.S. persons engaging in Cuba travel transactions on Airbnb, Inc.’s platform prior to OFAC issuing a specific license to Airbnb, Inc. to engage in such conduct.\n=== END KEY FACTS ===\n\n=== DOCUMENT TEXT ===\nEnforcement Release: January 3, 2022  OFAC Settles with Airbnb Payments, Inc. for $91,172.29 Related to Apparent Violations of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations  Airbnb Payments, Inc. (\"Airbnb Payments\"), a registered money services business incorporated in 2013 under the laws of the State of Delaware and headquartered in San Francisco, California, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Airbnb, Inc., has agreed to remit $91,172.29 to settle its potential civil liability for apparent violations of sanctions against Cuba administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This activity included payments related to guests traveling for reasons outside of OFAC’s authorized categories as well as a failure to keep certain required records associated with Cuba-related transactions. The settlement amount reflects OFAC’s determination that Airbnb Payments’ apparent violations were voluntarily self-disclosed and were non-egregious.  Description of the Conduct Leading to the Apparent Violations  Pursuant to communications with OFAC, Airbnb Payments conducted a forensic review based on an approved and statistically significant sampling of \"Stays\" (i.e., traveler lodging provided by Airbnb, Inc. \"Hosts\") and \"Experiences\" (i.e., traveler activities provided by Airbnb, Inc. Hosts) transactions involving Cuba. By extrapolating the results of that sampling review to the total transactions processed by Airbnb Payments between September 28, 2015 and March 1, 2020, it was determined that Airbnb Payments processed payments related to 3,464 extrapolated Stays transactions in Cuba by Airbnb, Inc. \"Guests\" traveling for reasons outside of OFAC’s 12 authorized categories.[1] The extrapolated average transaction amount processed for each such Stay was $139.52. Airbnb Payments also processed payments related to 3,076 extrapolated Experiences transactions where Airbnb Payments failed to keep records in accordance with the OFAC’s regulations. The extrapolated average transaction amount processed for each such Experience was $78.40. Airbnb Payments also processed payments related to 44 confirmed transactions involving non-U.S. persons engaging in Cuba travel transactions on Airbnb, Inc.’s platform prior to OFAC issuing a specific license to Airbnb, Inc. to engage in such conduct. The average transaction amount processed for those transactions was $111.09. As a result, Airbnb Payments processed payments on behalf of customers on Airbnb, Inc.’s platform in apparent violation of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR), 31 C.F.R. § 515.201 and § 515.572(b) (the \"Apparent Violations\").  [1] Travel-related transactions are permitted by general or specific licenses for certain travel related to the 12 categories of activities identified in § 515.560(a). Those travel-related transactions permitted by general license, subject to specified criteria and conditions, include: family visits; official business of the U.S. government, foreign governments, and certain intergovernmental organizations; journalistic activity; professional research; educational activities; religious activities; athletic competitions by amateur or semi-professional athletes or athletic teams; support for the Cuban people; humanitarian projects; activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes; exportation, importation, or transmission of information or information materials; and certain authorized export transactions. For additional information, please see Frequently Asked Questions 695-722.  These Apparent Violations occurred primarily because Airbnb, Inc. launched its Cuba business in April 2015, which would eventually extend to a global customer base, without fully addressing the complexities of operating a Cuba-related sanctions compliance program for internet-based travel services. As Airbnb, Inc. launched its services in Cuba following regulatory changes announced by the U.S. Government in January 2015, the scaling up of its services in Cuba appears to have outpaced the company’s ability to manage the associated sanctions risks via its technology platforms, leading to some of the Apparent Violations. For example, when Airbnb, Inc. first launched in Cuba, Airbnb Payments used a manual process to screen Hosts and Guests for potential sanctions issues until Airbnb Payments was able to implement a customized Internet Protocol blocking system designed to permit Cubans to act as Hosts on Airbnb, Inc.’s platform while simultaneously preventing Cubans from transacting as Guests on the platform. Similarly, the recordkeeping Apparent Violations related to the Experience transactions were primarily due to technical defects involving an older version of the Airbnb, Inc. mobile application that remained operational for Cuba-related travel. The older version of the application did not maintain complete functionality for Guests to make an attestation regarding their reason for travel to Cuba.  Airbnb Payments ultimately discovered the Apparent Violations after proactively initiating a comprehensive review of its sanctions compliance program. Airbnb Payments then voluntarily reported to OFAC the results of its review and lookback and implemented subsequent remedial measures designed to strengthen its sanctions compliance program and prevent recurrences. Additionally, throughout its engagement with OFAC, Airbnb Payments fully cooperated with OFAC, including by responding to multiple requests for information and agreeing to toll the statute of limitations.  Penalty Calculation and General Factors Analysis  The statutory maximum civil monetary penalty applicable in this matter is $600,601,408. However, OFAC determined that Airbnb Payments voluntarily self-disclosed the Apparent Violations and the Apparent Violations constitute a non-egregious case. Accordingly, under OFAC’s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines (\"Enforcement Guidelines\"), the base civil monetary penalty amount applicable in this matter equals the sum of one-half of the transaction value for each apparent violation, which is $364,689.  The settlement amount of $91,172.29 reflects OFAC’s consideration of the General Factors under the Enforcement Guidelines.  OFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:  (1)  Airbnb Payments’ apparent violations took place following a change in foreign policy with respect to Cuba in 2015 and associated modifications to the CACR that maintained certain specified restrictions. Airbnb Payments’ apparent violations with respect to Stays and Experiences, which related to the restrictions that were maintained as part of the CACR changes, undermined U.S. foreign policy towards Cuba at the time the violations occurred; and  (2)  Airbnb Payments is a large and sophisticated U.S.-based technology company.  OFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors:  (1)  Airbnb Payments has not received a penalty notice or Finding of Violation from OFAC in the five years preceding the earliest date of the transactions giving rise to the Apparent Violations; (2)  By proactively initiating a comprehensive review of its sanctions compliance program, and voluntarily reporting its findings to OFAC, Airbnb Payments provided substantial cooperation in connection with OFAC’s investigation into these Apparent Violations; and (3)  Airbnb Payments has represented that it undertook significant remedial measures to address its sanctions compliance deficiencies and as part of its settlement with OFAC has agreed to implement additional sanctions compliance commitments designed to minimize the risk of recurrence of similar conduct in the future, including: o  An IP blocking regime to account for issues related to permitting individuals located in Cuba to act as Hosts on Airbnb, Inc.’s platform, while simultaneously preventing such persons from transacting as Guests on the platform; o  The collection of country of residence and payment instrument information, in order determine whether users are nationals or residents of Cuba; o  The screening of Hosts in Cuba to ensure that no Hosts are Cuban government officials or communist party members, and also conducting manual checks to ensure that no listings are associated with the Cuba Restricted List; o  Requiring Guests that book a Stay or Experience to complete an attestation prior to completing a reservation; and o  Requiring that users listing a property in Cuba as a Host on Airbnb, Inc.’s platform to certify that the user is an independent entrepreneur.  Compliance Considerations  This action highlights the risks associated with entering new commercial markets, particularly one that has elevated sanctions risks such as Cuba, without fully anticipating the complexities of legally operating in a U.S.-sanctioned jurisdiction and fully implementing appropriate sanctions compliance controls. A failure to fully implement appropriate risk-based sanctions compliance measures into a company’s infrastructure at the time of a new product launch or entry into a new business line — particularly one involving internet-based services — could lead to apparent violations of OFAC regulations. Moreover, financial institutions that are processing transactions for companies that operate worldwide, including transactions involving individuals and entities ordinarily resident in, or doing business in, countries subject to U.S. sanctions, should understand the sanctions risks associated with those services and should take steps necessary to mitigate those risks. Finally, this case also highlights the importance of proactively identifying sanctions compliance deficiencies and implementing appropriate remedial measures, as well as the benefits of voluntary self-disclosure and cooperation with OFAC.  OFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources  On May 2, 2019, OFAC published A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments in order to provide organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in or with the United States or U.S. persons, or that use goods or services exported from the United States, with OFAC’s perspective on the essential components of a sanctions compliance program. The Framework also outlines how OFAC may incorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations and resolution of investigations resulting in settlements. The Framework includes an appendix that offers a brief analysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs OFAC has identified during its investigative process.  Information concerning the civil penalties process can be found in the OFAC regulations governing each sanctions program; the Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 501; and the Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. part 501, app. A.

The scope of this review included activity by users in certain countries and territories that were or are the target of U.S. sanctions laws. In July 2020, OFAC issued to us a cautionary letter and no administrative penalty with respect to certain aspects of that review concerning the Crimea region of Ukraine. The internal review also covered certain other issues concerning our compliance with OFAC’s sanctions program, focusing in particular on our business in Cuba, and as to our compliance with restrictions on transactions with specially designated nationals. We submitted the results of that internal review in final Voluntary Self Disclosures to OFAC in September 2020. In October 2020, OFAC issued to us cautionary letters and a no action letter, and no administrative penalties, with respect to the disclosed matters involving specially designated nationals. OFAC’s review of our voluntary self disclosure regarding Cuba is ongoing and we remain in close contact with OFAC. Depending upon OFAC’s assessment of the Cuba review, we could be subject to potentially significant monetary civil penalties and litigation, and our brand and reputation could be materially adversely affected.   (id. at 80).   This is, therefore, a notable case insofar as OFAC decided to resolve a portion of the violations disclosed in the context of a single disclosure process through an unpublished cautionary letter, and another portion with a published enforcement release. It is unclear why OFAC decided to bifurcate the \"cases\" in this fashion, or how often it does so. It may be that OFAC did so because the Cuba violations were determined to be attributable to Airbnb Payments, Inc., with the violations associated with the cautionary letter being attributable to the parent company.   2)      EXPLICIT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF \"SAMPLING\"   This appears to be the first enforcement release in which OFAC says that the number of violations serving as the basis for a penalty was an estimate derived from a sample of activity of a large corporation. Compare Internal OFAC Correspondence re: Large Bank-related Enforcement Actions.   It is unclear whether OFAC could, without the consent of an alleged sanctions violator, charge violations in this fashion. Presumably not. It is also unclear how often, in practice, OFAC investigates suspected violations in this fashion. Compare ENF 51433 (Administrative Subpoena and Related Correspondence) (another Cuba-travel case in which the investigation was done with reference to a presumably representative \"sample\" of trips).   3)      LEGAL BASIS FOR THE VIOLATIONS; FACILITATING CUBA TRAVEL FOR NON-U.S. PERSONS   Any U.S. person that facilitates travel to Cuba, by any person, deals in property in which \"Cuba\" has an \"interest\" (515.201). This is true whether or not the traveler is subject to U.S. jurisdiction.   Unfortunately, the enforcement release is drafted in a way that appears aimed at avoiding addressing certain difficult interpretive questions connected to the travel-related GLs found in the CACR.   Here, OFAC says that \"Airbnb Payments processed payments related to 3,464 extrapolated Stays transactions in Cuba by Airbnb, Inc. ‘Guests’ traveling for reasons outside of OFAC’s 12 authorized categories.\"   515.572(a) authorizes \"travel services in connection with travel-related transactions involving Cuba authorized pursuant to [the CACR].\" \"Authorized\" generally implies that it is activity over which OFAC has jurisdiction in principle.   If the payment processing were for guests traveling within \"OFAC’s 12 authorized categories,\" the payment processing would have been generally licensed by 515.572(a) (read in light of 515.421), at least if those guests were themselves subject to U.S. jurisdiction. In other words, the processing would have been licensed as incident to Airbnb’s provision of \"travel services in connection with travel-related transactions involving Cuba authorized pursuant to [the CACR]\" (515.572(a)). For non-U.S. guests whose travel was (i) outside of OFAC’s jurisdiction and (ii) described by the \"12 authorized categories\" such that the travel would have been \"authorized pursuant to [the CACR]\" if it were engaged in by a U.S. person, what result?   Of note here is the ambiguity surrounding the precise terms of Airbnb’s specific license, which appears to be valid as of 1/2022. OFAC says that, in addition to the \"payments related to 3,464 extrapolated Stays,\" \"Airbnb Payments also processed payments related to 44 confirmed transactions involving non-U.S. persons engaging in Cuba travel transactions on Airbnb, Inc.’s platform prior to OFAC issuing a specific license to Airbnb, Inc. to engage in such conduct.\" (Emphasis added).   It is not clear whether \"such conduct\" refers to (i) travel to Cuba for any reason, (ii) only travel to Cuba that would have been authorized by 515.560 (as one of the \"12 authorized categories\") if the traveler were actually subject to U.S. jurisdiction to begin with, or (iii) something else (e.g. the \"12 categories\" with some modifications specific to the specific license). Again, on its face, 515.572(a) authorizes transactions related to travel \"involving Cuba authorized pursuant to [the CACR],\" rather than transactions that would have been authorized pursuant to the CACR if the traveler were subject to OFAC’s jurisdiction. It has, however, never been entirely clear whether OFAC interprets 515.572(a) to cover transactions related to non-U.S. person underlying travel that is outside of OFAC’s jurisdiction, but would be (i) within OFAC’s jurisdiction and (ii) authorized by 515.560 if the traveler were a U.S. person. For more on this issue, see General Note on the Provision of Services Related to Travel by non-U.S. Persons to Cuba (OFAC has had many opportunities to clarify the relationship between 515.572 and transactions related to travel by non-U.S. persons that would be authorized if engaged in by U.S. persons, but has consistently declined to do so, but see LICENSE No. CU-2016-329116-5 In sum, the enforcement release does not appear to resolve the interpretive questions raised by the text of 515.572(a), as it relates to services provided to persons not subject to U.S. jurisdiction. It is not clear whether any of the \"3,464 extrapolated Stays transactions in Cuba by Airbnb, Inc. ‘Guests’ traveling for reasons outside of OFAC’s 12 authorized categories\" were stays by non-U.S. persons. If all of those stays were by U.S. persons and there were only 44 non-U.S. person-related violations, it would almost certainly mean that 515.572(a) does cover non-U.S. person travel in principle, and that the specific license was issued to cover stays by non-U.S. persons that were not described by the \"12 categories\" (update: see LICENSE No. CU-2016-329116-5 4)    515.572, 515.421 AND ALLOWING CUBANS TO \"HOST\" OFAC reveals that Airbnb has a Cuba-related specific license, which, as noted above, authorizes \"payments related to…transactions involving non-U.S. persons engaging in Cuba travel transactions on Airbnb, Inc.’s platform.\" What else, if anything, does the specific license authorize apart from payments connected to non-U.S. person travel to Cuba? Elsewhere in the enforcement notice, OFAC refers, as a \"mitigating factor,\" to an \"IP blocking regime to account for issues related to permitting individuals located in Cuba to act as Hosts on Airbnb, Inc.’s platform, while simultaneously preventing such persons from transacting as Guests on the platform.\" This might normally suggest that persons in Cuba cannot act as hosts, but in the next breath, OFAC reports that Airbnb implemented the \"screening of Hosts in Cuba to ensure that no Hosts are Cuban government officials or communist party members, and also conducting manual checks to ensure that no listings are associated with the Cuba Restricted List.\" On that basis, it is relatively clear that Cubans can \"host\" in some capacity, and the \"IP blocking regime to account for issues related to\" such hosting may refer to the blocking of IP addresses related to certain entities within Cuba (e.g. those on the Cuba Prohibited Accommodations List). Therefore, it seems clear that either (i) 515.572 (\"travel services in connection with travel-related transactions involving Cuba authorized pursuant to [the CACR]\") covers Airbnb allowing certain Cuban nationals to serve as \"hosts,\" or otherwise (ii) the specific license covers that. (A perusal of Airbnb’s Havana listings as of 1/4/2022 makes it all the clearer that at least some \"Cuban nationals\" (as defined in 515.302) are permitted to serve as hosts). It is extremely likely that the legal basis for permitting the hosting is 515.572, read in light of 515.421. 515.421 (Transactions ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction) says that and \"transaction ordinarily incident to a licensed transaction and necessary to give effect thereto is also authorized,\" and contains exceptions that include (i) \"transaction by or with a prohibited official of the Government of Cuba, as defined in §515.337, or a prohibited member of the Cuban Communist Party, as defined in §515.338, where the terms of the applicable general or specific license expressly exclude transactions with such persons,\" as well as \"[l]odging, paying for lodging, or making any reservation for or on behalf of a third party to lodge, at any property on the Cuba Prohibited Accommodations List.\" In other words, the screening implemented by Airbnb is what would have been required if Airbnb relied on 515.572 (in light of 515.421) as its authority for permitting Cubans to serve as hosts. If the only authority for this were the specific license referenced elsewhere in the enforcement notice, one would expect OFAC to make this clear. Compare ENF 51433 (Administrative Subpoena and Related Correspondence) (contracting with Cuban tour providers).   5)    RELATIONSHIP TO 515.584(c)  515.584(c) provides that:  \"All transactions incident to the processing and payment of credit and debit cards involving travel-related and other transactions consistent with §515.560 are authorized.\"   See Removed Cuba OFAC FAQs (looseleaf) #54 (515.584(c) allows (or at least allowed) for \"all transactions incident to the processing and payment of credit and debit cards transactions for third-country nationals traveling to, from, or within Cuba,\" and that is irrespective of the underlying reason for travel.) Can this enforcement action be reconciled with the possibility that Removed Cuba OFAC FAQs (looseleaf) #54 is still a valid interpretation of 515.584(c)? (Note that OFAC has not explicitly reversed it). We believe that the answer is \"yes,\" even if what Airbnb Payments did could be—and most likely should generally be—characterized as \"the processing and payment of credit and debit cards transactions for third-country nationals traveling to, from, or within Cuba.\" The rub here is that Airbnb Payments processed those transactions in the context of the facilitation of otherwise illegal activities by Airbnb Payments’ parent company (i.e., the provision of travel services that were outside the scope of the license at 515.572). If Airbnb Payments were a U.S. person entity and all it did was engage in the \"processing and payment of credit and debit cards transactions for third-country nationals traveling to, from, or within Cuba,\" that may have been legal even if the travel was outside of the 12 categories, so long as the travel service providers were not subject to U.S. jurisdiction and violating the CACR through the provision of such travel services.   6)       PENALTY CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES AND THE RECORDKEEPING VIOLATIONS   OFAC says that \"[t]he statutory maximum civil monetary penalty applicable in this matter is $600,601,408.\" Where does that number come from? 501.701(a)(3) of the RPPR says that \"[t]he Secretary of the Treasury may impose a civil penalty of not more than $91,816 per violation on any person who violates any license, order, or regulation issued under TWEA.\" The 600,601,408 appears to be the product of ($~91,816) * (44+3,076+3,464), where \"$~91,816\" represents the dollar amount referenced in 501.701(a)(3) at the time the violation occurred (i.e. excluding adjustments for inflation all the way up through 2022).   This is notable for a few reasons. First, it means that OFAC charged thousands (3,076) of recordkeeping violations (citing violations of 515.572(b)) on top of the underlying substantive violations of 515.201. This is extremely rare (but see Civil Enforcement Information - DHL). It is not clear from the face of the enforcement announcement whether the recordkeeping violations pertain to the same transactions that were associated with substantive violations of 515.201 because the underlying travel was outside the scope of 515.572(a). These were presumably completely separate transactions, since 515.572(b) refers to the retention of records in connection with the provision of authorized travel services, and the substantive CACR violations were violations precisely because they were not \"authorized travel services\".  The charging of recordkeeping violations in this manner is extremely uncommon, but was probably done in this case given how difficult the low value of the transactions made it for OFAC to impose a reasonable penalty. $91,172.29 may be a record low, given the number of substantive violations charged.

If overflights themselves were exempt, payments for overflights would also be exempt. See Spirit Airlines, Inc. (2008) for overflight-related enforcement action. The same is true of air ambulance services. What the GL does not clarify, however, is whether overflights of a sanctioned destination are necessarily within the scope of OFAC's jurisdiction to begin with, presuming that no \"services\" are received in connection with the overflight.  3) [RESERVED]  4) More recently issued GLs cover overflights and other activities where the aircraft is \"chartered to\" a U.S. person (e.g. 515.548). This would, at a minimum, presumably be specifically licensed by OFAC, if not interpreted as being within the scope of the GL. Concerning the applicability of sanctions regulations to vessels and aircraft on the basis of their registration and/or operational control by U.S. persons, see General Note on OFAC’s Assertion of Worldwide Jurisdiction over non-U.S. Origin Vessels and Aircraft with Certain Relationships to the United States (System Ed. Note).  5) Refer to FAQ # 417, and comments thereto, dealing with the overflight issue in the context of both primary and secondary sanctions.  6) The scope of this GL is somewhat confusing on the question of transactions ancillary to underlying transactions not subject to the sanctions regulations, and transactions by entities subject to the ITSR solely as a result of 560.215. This issue is discussed in General Note on Sanctions Provisions for which Determining Applicability Requires \"Counterfactual\" Analysis of Transactions (System Ed. Note), the relevant portion of which is reproduced below:  As discussed above, there are two particularly tricky aspects to the analysis of transactions in counterfactual situations. The first is distinguishing what differentiates a \"term or condition\" from a general statement concerning the scope of a GL, and the second is determining what U.S.-oriented \"person or place\" aspects of the scope of a GL may, when conducting a counterfactual analysis, be \"replaced\" with the name of a foreign country. These are overlapping questions inasmuch as one can say that all \"person or place\" aspects of the scope of a GL that cannot be \"replaced\" with the name of a foreign country are actually \"terms\" or \"conditions\" of a GL.  It would appear that, in general, when the term \"U.S. person\" defines the scope of a license, it may always be replaced with \"[foreign country] person,\" and authorizations for imports into the U.S. and exports from the U.S. may be assumed to apply to imports into and exports from a given foreign country, but the terms \"U.S.\" and \"United States\" appear in other contexts.   Consider 560.522:  \"Payments to Iran of charges for services rendered by the Government of Iran in connection with the overflight of Iran or emergency landing in Iran of aircraft owned by a United States person or registered in the United States are authorized.\"   Here \"United States person\" may be replaced with [person of foreign country X], but may \"aircraft owned by a United States person or registered in the United States\" be replaced with \"aircraft owned by a [foreign country X] person or registered in [foreign country X],\" for the purposes of applying 560.556? If the answer is no, entities subject to the ITSR as a result of 560.215 are put in a much worse position than their U.S. person counterparts, since the GL applies only to the small subset of foreign planes owned by U.S. persons or registered in the U.S.   It would also mean that the plane being \"owned\" by a U.S. person or \"registered\" in the US are \"terms\" or \"conditions\" of the GL even though they were not prefaced with language identifying them as such. If the answer is that all instances of \"United States\" in 560.522 may be replaced with the name of the foreign country, that would serve the apparent purpose of 560.556 of putting foreign owned or-controlled companies on equal footing with their U.S. counterparts, but \"equal footing\" is not exactly a principle that can be applied across the board in counterfactual scenarios.   In sum, the most difficult application of the counterfactual question concerns determinations of whether GLs apply to non-U.S. persons when the GLs contain irregular references to \"United States.\" This is most likely to be encountered in the context of GLs that pre-date 2012, i.e. those initially written without the thinking about how they would be looked at in the context of counterfactual analyses.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Is a license required to enter into an over flight permit agreement with the Cuban Civil Air Authority, even if there is no cost? Yes. A permit from the Government of Cuba is property in which the Government of Cuba has an interest. Therefore, a license from OFAC is necessary prior to obtaining the permit, even if no funds are changing hands at this point in the process. Many U.S. companies provide permitting and payment services on behalf of their clients. If such a facilitator holds an OFAC license to obtain the permits and make the payments to the Government of Cuba, there is no need for each individual client to obtain a separate OFAC authorization.

Compare non-binding memoranda of understanding which appear to not reach OFAC's definition of \"property\" within the boilerplate definition. Compare Civil Enforcement Information (FOV) - Dominica Maritime Registry (2017); FAC- No. C-142787.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

  "answer": "According to [Notable Examples Illustrating the Scope of the IEEPA Travel Exemption (Document 7)], paying “landings fees and ground handling payments” to a blocked airport operator in connection with a charter flight is not exempt under the travel exemption. In this document, one of the examples specifically notes that such payments—particularly when connected with a charter flight that is not for ordinary tourist travel—are [NOT EXEMPT]. This guidance, which cites Case No. Ukraine‑EO13662‑2018‑353695‑1 (also reflected in Document 1), indicates that although certain transactions incident to travel may be exempt, the payment of landing fees and ground handling services to a blocked operator falls outside that exemption. \n\nIn summary, based on the available guidance, the answer is that these payments are not covered by the travel exemption."
