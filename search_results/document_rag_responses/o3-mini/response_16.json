Iran: Travel Exemption\n=== END TITLE ===\n\n=== DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n031125-FACRL-IA-12 November 25, 2003  IRAN: TRAVEL EXEMPTION FAC No. [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  [text deleted]  Dear [text deleted]:    This is with regard to your letters of January 9, 2003, June 6, 2003, and June 12, 2003 to the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") on behalf of [a U.S. person]. In your letters you inquired whether the travel exemption provisions contained in § 560.210(d) of the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the \"Regulations\"), authorize [U.S. persons] to engage in the following activities involving the arrangement of air travel between the United States and Iran:  1)  Publication of schedules of flights between Europe and Iran; 2)  Publication of interline airfares; 3)  Acceptance of reservations for travel between the United States and Iran; 4)  Issuance of airline tickets for the entire trip between the United States and Iran; and 5)  Advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran.  Section 560.204 of the Regulations prohibits the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, technology, or services to Iran or the Government of Iran. However, § 560.210(c) of the Regulations provides that the prohibitions do not apply to the importation from and the exportation to any country of information and informational materials fully created and in existence at the time of the transaction.In addition, § 560.210(d) of the Regulations provides that the prohibitions contained in § 560.204 do not apply to transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, including importation of accompanied baggage for personal use, maintenance within any country including payment of living expenses and acquisition of goods or services for personal use, and arrangement or facilitation of such travel including nonscheduled air, sea, or land voyages. Section 560.210(d) of the Regulations further provides that the exemption extends to transactions with Iranian carriers and those involving group tours and payments in Iran made for transactions directly incident to travel.   Based upon the information submitted, we have concluded that, with the exceptions noted below, the exemptions set forth in § 560.210 (c and d) of the Regulations are applicable to all of the above listed activities involving airline travel between the United States and Iran.  With respect to the advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran, the Regulations do not prohibit such transactions unless they are undertaken at the behest of a person in Iran or an Iranian entity. The Regulations would prohibit advertising-related transactions undertaken at the behest of a person or entity in Iran, unless the information or informational materials exemption applies. To fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption, such transactions must be limited to the direct dissemination of copy-ready materials. A U.S. person cannot provide any other related services to Iran, such as the development of advertising materials or an advertising campaign or serving as an agent for the buying or brokering of advertising space, without OFAC authorization. Such activities do not fall within the scope of the information and informational materials exemption. Such activities also would not fall within the scope of the travel exemption, as they are not directly incident to travel.  Although the travel exemption set forth in § 560.210(d) of the Regulations applies regardless of whether the connecting carrier is Iran Air or another Iranian air carrier, it applies only to arranging travel and should not be construed to authorize transactions not directly incident to travel, such as the creation or enhancement of a travel reservation service in Iran. Further, while [U.S. persons] are authorized to accept reservations, issue tickets for travel on Iranian carriers, and advertise air service between the United States and Iran (subject to the caveats referenced above), any U.S. origin financial services used to exchange payments with Iran must fall within the scope of the authorizations set forth in § 560.516 of the Regulations, which necessitate the use of non-U.S., non-Iranian financial institutions as intermediaries to such transactions.  If you have any additional questions about the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, you may refer to our web site at www.treas.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.   Sincerely,   [Signature]  R. Richard Newcomb Director Office of Foreign Assets Control    \n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) The Guidance analyzes a set of transactions at the intersection of the Berman Amendment exemptions for travel and transactions ordinarily incident thereto (560.210(d)) and the exemption for informational materials transactions (560.210(c)).   With regard to OFAC's declaration that \"the Regulations do not prohibit [the advertisement of air service between the United States and Iran] unless they are undertaken at the behest of a person in Iran or an Iranian entity,\" compare FAC No. CU-156123, considering a Cuban travel company paying a U.S. person to broadcast advertising as being within the scope of informational materials exemption (i.e. where the travel exemption was not available). The reason why the advertising generally is not permitted is because OFAC deems it i) not ordinarily incident to travel, and ii) more of a service than a transaction incident to the import/export of informational materials, but when the advertising transaction only involves the dissemination of pre-existing materials, it is exempt. [1] As confirmed by FAC No. CU-156123, \"copy ready\" does not imply that qualifying materials cannot be in audio/visual format.   2) Other guidance clarifies OFAC's positions on the publication of fares and acceptance of reservations (FACRL-CU-01 2002), acting as a travel agent (Case No. IA-17270) and dealing with an entity designated pursuant to a sanctions program with a travel exemption (Case No. IA-16194). See also our discussion on SEC filings describing activities done by companies purporting to act under the Berman Amendment exemptions for travel.   Compare Case No. IA-17270 with the statement that \"the creation or enhancement of a travel reservation service in Iran\" is prohibited.  Case No. IA-17270, issued 10 years after the publication of this guidance, seems to stand for the proposition that doing more than simply accepting reservations is exempt, at least in connection with Iranians traveling to the U.S.  3) Guidance should apply generally to all IEEPA-based programs with a travel exemption. With respect to Cuba, a combination of the informational materials exemption of the CACR combined with current general licenses related to travel will have much the same result, but not in all cases.    4) See Delta Air Lines, Inc., Correspondence with the SEC Office of Global Security Risk (2007): sale of tickets pursuant to codeshare agreements considered exempt when the tickets involve travel to sanctioned destinations other than Cuba.  [1] Refer to section 2(I) of the \"Ordinarily Incident\" System Note; comment to Case No. IA-2012-299245-1.  5) See Iran-Related Civil Aviation Industry Advisory (2019), and comments thereto, concerning the relationship between primary and secondary sanctions in the aviation industry.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Note that while WMDPSR persons and entities are eligible for the exemptions listed here, many such persons, particular Iranians, are also SDGTs. Because the Berman Amendment exemptions do not apply to the GTSR, being designated pursuant to both renders one ineligible for these exemptions (544.101).   1) INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS  The scope of the informational materials exemption of the sort found here has been interpreted identically across programs. The Research System contains over 100 guidance letters, interpretive rulings, FAQs and other documents addressing the various interpretive issues that have come up with regard to the exemption.

On its face, it applies only to transactions otherwise prohibited by 576.201(a)(3), which implements a standard, IEEPA-based, list-based blocking order. It should be noted, however, that there is now reason to believe that the IEEPA exemptions would apply even to persons blocked pursuant to 576.201(a)(1)-(2), to the degree that they do not appear on or are related to persons appearing on any UN-administered sanctions list. Refer to General Note on the Applicability of IEEPA/TWEA Exemptions in EOs and Sanctions Regulations not Specifically Mentioning Them (System Ed. Note). This is also discussed in General Note on the Iraq Stabilization and Insurgency Sanctions Regulations and the Relationship Between the Authorities Underlying the Regulations (System Ed. Note).

Can an insurer offer global travel insurance and worldwide travel assistance without violating U.S. sanctions?   Yes, provided that the provision of global travel insurance and travel assistance relate to travel that is exempt or authorized. The authority granted to the President by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not include the authority to regulate or prohibit, directly or indirectly, transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country. See 50 U.S.C. §1702 (b)(4). OFAC sanctions programs issued pursuant to IEEPA generally do not prohibit transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, including the issuance and provision of travel-related insurance coverage related to exempt travel.  Although the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) does not exempt travel from the President’s authority, the TWEA-based Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) authorize travel in limited circumstances. Travel related services, including travel insurance coverage, may only be provided in Cuba pursuant to a valid general or specific OFAC license. For example, if the traveler is a U.S. person traveling to Cuba pursuant to a valid OFAC authorization, a U.S. insurer may issue travel insurance to the traveler without obtaining a separate authorization.  Similarly, U.S. persons may issue or provide coverage for global health, life, or travel insurance policies for individuals ordinarily resident in a country outside of Cuba who travel to or within Cuba, pursuant to the general license at 31 C.F.R. § 515.580 of the CACR, as well as service such policies and pay claims arising from events that occurred while the individual was traveling in, or to or from, Cuba. (For more information, see FAQ 774.)  Additionally, insurers should check OFAC's List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) and other sanctions lists to ensure that no prohibited services are rendered to persons or entities on those lists.  Date Updated: November 13, 2024  Date Released January 15, 2015  ---  104. Can an insurer offer global travel insurance and worldwide travel assistance without violating U.S. sanctions? The provision of all travel related services are authorized for all OFAC country sanctions programs (including Burma, Iran and Sudan) except Cuba. Travel related services may only be provided in Cuba pursuant to a valid general or specific OFAC license. If the traveler is a U.S. person traveling to Cuba pursuant to a valid OFAC license, travel insurance may be issued to the traveler by a U.S. insurer without a separate license. Similarly, the issuance or provision of coverage for global health, life, or travel insurance policies for individuals ordinarily resident in a country outside of Cuba who travel to or within Cuba is authorized by general license, as is the servicing of such policies and payment of claim arising from events that occurred while the individual was traveling in, or to or from, Cuba. Additionally, insurers should check OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and other sanctions lists to ensure that no prohibited services are rendered to persons or entities on those lists. [01-15-2015]\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) OFAC acknowledges that the issue of travel insurance is ordinarily incident to travel (where travel is exempt).  2) While there are no Crimea embargo regulations to say so explicitly, OFAC's statement here presumably applies to the Crimea embargo as well, seeing as it was enacted under IEEPA and the source of the authorization for the issue of global travel insurance is that it is ordinarily incident to travel exempt from regulation under IEEPA. This FAQ was issued/last updated subsequent to the issue of EO 13685.  3) The North Korean sanctions regulations also exempt transactions \"ordinarily incident to travel\" even though travel to North Korea has been effectively barred through non-sanctions-based means (i.e. special passport requirements).  4) FAQ amended on 11-13-24 to specify that \"[t]he authority granted to the President by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not include the authority to regulate or prohibit, directly or indirectly, transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country,\" such that regulations and EOs need not make any specific reference to the travel exemption for it to apply. See generally General Note on the Applicability of IEEPA/TWEA Exemptions in EOs and Sanctions Regulations not Specifically Mentioning Them.   5) FAQ amended to specify that \"the issuance and provision of travel-related insurance coverage related to exempt travel,\" i.e. it is not only in the context of \"global travel insurance and worldwide travel assistance\" that such insurance is exempt from regulation. (See Notable Examples Illustrating the Scope of the Travel Exemption).    6) FAQ amended on 11-13-24 to clarify that the provision of travel insurance coverage related to authorized travel to Cuba is a \"travel-related service\" (for purposes of 515.572 of the CACR).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

The exportation of such items or services and the provision, sale, or leasing of such capacity or facilities to a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to §584.201(a) are prohibited. (c) Travel. The prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, including importation or exportation of accompanied baggage for personal use, maintenance within any country including payment of living expenses and acquisition of goods or services for personal use, and arrangement or facilitation of such travel including nonscheduled air, sea, or land voyages. (d) Humanitarian donations. The prohibitions of this part do not apply to donations by United States persons of articles, such as food, clothing, and medicine, intended to be used to relieve human suffering.\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  This is a standard \"Exempt transactions\" provision for an IEEPA-based, list-based blocking program, but note that the MASR implement a sanctions statute that only cross-references the President’s IEEPA powers, and is not actually an IEEPA-based authority. Compare 542.211, and comments thereto, and see General Note on the Applicability of IEEPA/TWEA Exemptions in EOs and Sanctions Regulations not Specifically Mentioning Them.  1) INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS  The scope of the informational materials exemption of the sort found here has been interpreted identically across programs. The Research System contains over 100 guidance letters, interpretive rulings, FAQs and other documents addressing the various interpretive issues that have come up with regard to the exemption. Refer to, e.g. Examples of the \"Substantive or Artistic Alteration or Enhancement\" and \"Fully Created and in Existence\" Standards, Notes Common to the \"Information or informational materials\" Definitional Provision, Notable Applications of the Definition of \"Information or Informational Materials\" and Examples of Transactions Exempt as Incident to Underlying Informational Materials Transactions.  2) TRAVEL   a) The scope of the exemption for travel and transactions ordinarily incident thereto been interpreted identically across programs. The Research System contains a multitude of guidance letters, interpretive rulings, FAQs and other documents addressing the various interpretive issues that have come up with regard to the exemption. See Notable Examples Illustrating the scope of the travel Exemption.  3) PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS  The Personal Communications exemption is common across programs, and interpretations of it can be found in the Research System by selecting the \"Key Legal Issues\" search criterion associated with the personal communications exemption. [12-23-23 UPDATE - See Case No. IA-2017-339679-1 (certain \"mentoring\" services provided by a non-profit over the internet through social media are exempt under the IEEPA \"personal communications\" exemption)].   4) DONATIONS/HUMANITARIAN  584.206(d) of the Magnitsky Act Sanctions Regulation (MASR) is the only \"humanitarian donations\" exemption to appear in a \"list-based\" (i.e. non-embargo) regulatory provision. This is somewhat of an anomaly. Typically, list-based blocking sanctions are issued pursuant to or in conjunction with executive orders that invoke the President’s IEEPA powers pursuant to a \"national emergency\" and in which, as a matter of course, the President exercises his option under IEEPA to exclude the making of donations to sanctioned persons from the from the range of transaction types exempt from regulation.   This is generally true even when the sanctions are imposed pursuant to a specific statute passed by Congress. Compare EO 13818, which declares a national emergency in connection with the implementation of the \"Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act\" and \"opts out\" of donations exemption contained in IEEPA.  In this rare case, however, the MASR were issued directly under the authority of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act (Magnitsky Act), of which Sec. 406(a)(1) grants the President to block persons to the extent permissible under IEEPA but does not account for the donation issue. Here, there was no executive order issued in conjunction with the MASR.  All of this is to say that the \"humanitarian donations\" exemption is in the MASR only exists because the President did not declare a national emergency solely for the purpose of implementing the Magnitsky Act. It is not clear why no executive order implements the Magnitsky Act, but what is almost virtually certain is that the existence of 584.206(d) was an unintended consequence of implementing the Magnitsky Act without the concurrent declaration of a \"national emergency.\" 584.206(d) does not reflect a considered policy preference on the part of the Executive Branch to make \"humanitarian donations\" available to persons sanctioned to the Magnitsky Act, none of which are presumed to be indigent in the first place. In sum, you ought to be 100% sure that any such transactions engaged in under the authority of  584.206(d) are of a sort that qualify for the exemption. In the event that OFAC were made aware of any such transaction, we would expect OFAC to take a close look at it with a particularly skeptical eye.   \"IN GENERAL.—The President shall exercise all powers granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (except that the requirements of section 202 of such Act (50 U.S.C. 1701) shall not apply) to the extent necessary to freeze and prohibit all transactions in all property and interests in property of a person who is on the list required by section 404(a) of this Act if such property and interests in property are in the United States, come within the United States, or are or come within the possession or control of a United States person.\"  5) TRANSACTIONS ORDINARILY INCIDENT TO EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS, GENERALLY  To the degree that a transaction is exempt from regulation as a result of an IEEPA-mandated exemption (i.e. personal communications, informational materials, travel, (and sometimes donations)), all transactions incident to the exempt transactions are also, themselves, exempt. See Notes Common to the 400-Level Interpretive Provisions Authorizing Transactions \"Ordinarily Incident\" to a Licensed Transaction; Transactions Incident to Others in General (System Ed. Note). This is true whether or not the underlying transaction involves a U.S. person. See General Note and Associated Matrix Pertaining to U.S. Person Engagement in Transactions Incident to Transactions by Foreign Persons (System Ed. Note).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

The insurance need not be issued in connection with a global policy, as is the case with the CACR. Note that because the CACR has no travel exemption, the provision of all insurance related to Cuba travel is handled through general licenses (see e.g. 515.580).  2) While there are no Crimea embargo regulations to say so explicitly, this presumably applies to the Crimea embargo as well, seeing as it was enacted under IEEPA and the source of the authorization for the issue of global travel insurance is that it is ordinarily incident to travel exempt from regulation under IEEPA.  The North Korean sanctions regulations also exempt transactions \"ordinarily incident to travel\" even though actual travel to North Korea by U.S. passport holders has been effectively barred through non-sanctions-based means.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Blye Chief, Office of Global Security Risk U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549-5546  Re: Delta Air Lines, Inc. Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2005 Filed March 27, 2006 File No. 1-05424  [...]  1. We note from your website that you may have \"partnerships\" with other carriers or otherwise offer passenger flights to and from Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, countries identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the State Department and subject to sanctions administered by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security and the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Your 10-K does not include any information regarding contacts with these countries. Please describe your current, past and anticipated operations in and contacts with each of these countries, if any, including through affiliates, contract carriers, codesharing, alliance or other \"partners\" and other direct and indirect arrangements. Tell us whether and explain the extent to which the governments of these countries, or entities controlled by them, receive financing or act as intermediaries in connection with any such operations.  Delta does not operate any flights to or from Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria (the \"Five Countries\"). Similarly, Delta has no operations in any of the Five Countries. Delta has no assets (including no jointly owned businesses) or employees in any of the Five Countries.   Delta is a signatory to \"codeshare\" or \"interline\" agreements with many foreign air carriers. Although we sometimes refer to such carriers as our \"partners,\" these codeshare and interline relationships are not legal partnerships; they are simply cooperative marketing relationships pursuant to which each carrier may sell tickets for air transportation on flights operated by the other carrier.[1]   Codeshare agreements are common in the air transportation industry and allow carriers to market and sell tickets on each other’s flights. The scope of these agreements is typically limited to permit codesharing only on certain routes. Delta has codeshare agreements, for example, with AeroMexico, Air France, Alitalia, and Korean Air. All of Delta’s codeshare relationships with foreign carriers have been reviewed and approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation. They fully comply with U.S. law. Delta does not market or sell tickets for travel to/from any of the Five Countries pursuant to any of these codeshare relationships.  Interline agreements are also common in the airline industry. They allow participating carriers to sell a single ticket for travel on multiple carriers, allowing the passenger’s baggage to be transferred seamlessly between connecting flights of each airline. Delta has interline agreements with more than 200 U.S. and foreign air carriers.  Although some foreign air carriers with which Delta has interline or codeshare relationships offer service to countries that are the subject of regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"), Delta policy prohibits the provision by Delta of services to, or engagement in transactions with, sanctioned countries, directly or through any codeshare or interline relationship, unless authorized under U.S. law.  U.S. law does not prohibit U.S. persons from traveling to and from Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.[2]  Moreover, current OFAC regulations generally do not restrict the exportation and importation of services to and from North Korea and Syria.[3]  Although OFAC regulations generally restrict the exportation and importation of services to and from Iran and Sudan, the regulations contain an exemption for travel as well as for arrangement and facilitation of such travel to and from these countries.[4]  Accordingly, U.S. air carriers are not prohibited from selling tickets for travel to and from those countries on flights operated by other carriers. Therefore, Delta employees or any one of the tens of thousands of independent travel agents authorized to issue tickets may sell interline tickets issued on Delta ticket stock for travel that includes flight segments operated by other carriers to or from Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria. When this occurs, Delta receives a small commission from the transaction. Therefore, Delta has lawfully received a de minimis amount of revenue from the sale of such tickets, as reported in response to Comment 3 below.  U.S. law prohibits persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction from traveling to and from Cuba, unless authorized by a specific license issued by OFAC or pursuant to the terms of a general license set forth in OFAC’s Cuban Assets Control Regulations (\"CACR\").[5]  Delta’s compliance policy therefore explicitly prohibits its employees or any independent travel agent issuing tickets on Delta ticket stock from selling any tickets or booking any flights to or from Cuba.  Notwithstanding this clear policy and the compliance procedures implemented by Delta,[6]  however, independent travel agents or Delta employees occasionally exceed their authority and issue interline tickets on Delta ticket stock for travel to or from Cuba. The vast majority of such tickets are issued by foreign, independent travel agents who are not subject to Delta supervision or control. As a result of these rare violations of Delta policy, Delta received a de minimis amount of revenue (in the form of commissions) for flights operated by non-U.S. carriers to/from Cuba, as reported in response to Comment 3 below.  Delta’s wholly owned subsidiary, Comair, does not operate in the Five Countries. Delta has contract carrier agreements with six unaffiliated regional carriers but none of these relationships involve operations or business in the Five Countries. Delta does not own, manage or control the operations of any other carrier other than Delta. As a result, Delta cannot respond to the Staff’s inquiries on behalf of or with respect to any such carriers.   Delta does not provide loans or similar financing to any government of the Five Countries, or entities controlled by them. With respect to payments for services rendered, Delta has received a license from OFAC authorizing payments to Cuba for overflight services provided to Delta’s aircraft that enter airspace controlled by Cuba en route to destinations other than Cuba. Delta periodically makes such payments to the Cuban government and provides OFAC with an annual detailed accounting, in accordance with the terms of its license. In addition, through the U.S.-based airline clearinghouse that administers payments related to interline flights, carriers located in some of the Five Countries may receive interline settlement payments from Delta for flight segments operated by those carriers.  [1] Although our website and other marketing materials occasionally refer to the carriers with which we have interline or codeshare relationships as our \"Worldwide Partners®\", these relationshps are not legal partnerships. The phrase \"Worldwide Partners\" is a registered trademark which Delta has used since October 1994 to market its global air transportation network through such cooperative marketing relationships. See U.S. Reg. No. 2022300. To reduce the possibility of confusion, we are reviewing our website to ensure that the phrase \"Worldwide Partners\" is appropriately identified as a registered trademark. [2] OFAC’s Terrorism List Governments Sanctions Regulations do not prohibit travel to countries that have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism. 31 C.F.R. Part 596. In addition, OFAC’s country-specific sanctions regulations do not restrict travel to Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. See id. Parts 560, 500, 538, and 542.

Crowell & Moring LLP 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20004-2595  Dear Ms. Halloway:  This responds to your letter dated March 30, 2011, to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"), requesting confirmation that the guidance provided by OFAC in a letter dated November 25, 2003 (the \"November 2003 Guidance\") remains fully effective and that, in any event, the travel exemption provision of the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the \"ITR\"), authorizes U.S. airlines to enter into interline and special prorate agreements with Iranian airlines, including Iran Air. Your letter states that U.S. and other airlines routinely enter into Interline Ticketing and Baggage (\"ITBs\") and Special Prorate Agreements (\"SPAs\") with other airlines that operate in markets they do not serve with their own aircraft. Your letter explains that an ITB is a commercial agreement between two or more airlines to handle passengers and baggage traveling on itineraries that require multiple airlines, allowing passengers to pay for a particular journey with a single transaction and in one currency, regardless of the number of airlines or flight segments involved. Your letter further states that airlines typically use either the industry-wide Multilateral Proration Agreement (\"MPA\") or an SPA, under which proration is determined by a different methodology than that used by the MPA.  The ITR generally prohibit the importation into the United States of any goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran. ITR, § 560.201. The ITR also generally prohibit the exportation, re-exportation, sale, or supply of any goods, technology, or services, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITR, § 560.204. Additionally, the ITR generally prohibit U.S. persons, wherever located, from engaging in any transaction or dealing in or related to goods or services of Iranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; or goods, technology, or services for exportation, re-exportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran. ITR, § 560.206(a). This prohibition includes but is not limited to purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing. ITR, § 560.206(b). The ITR define the term \"U.S. person\" to mean any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. ITR, § 560.314.  However, section 560.210 of the ITR contains certain exemptions to the prohibitions contained in the ITR. Specifically, transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, including importation or exportation of accompanied baggage for personal use, maintenance within any country including payment of living expenses and acquisition of goods or services for personal use, and arrangement or facilitation of such travel including nonscheduled air, sea, or land voyages are exempt from the ITR’s prohibitions. ITR, § 560.210(d). In addition, transactions related to the importation from any country and the exportation to any country of information or informational materials, whether commercial or otherwise, regardless of format or medium or transmission, are exempt.  ITR, § 560.210(c). The term \"information and informational materials\" includes publications, films, posters, phonograph records, photographs, microfilms, microfiche, tapes, compact disks, CD ROMS, artworks, and news wire feeds. ITR, § 560.315. Please note, however, that the aforementioned exemption does not apply to transactions related to items not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions, or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials, or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services. ITR, § 560.210(c)(2).  On February 5, 2012, the President signed Executive Order 13599, \" Blocking Property of the Government of Iran and Iranian Financial Institutions,\" which blocks all property and interests in property of the Government of Iran, including the Central Bank of Iran, and any Iranian financial institution, that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, including any foreign branch. However, OFAC also issued two general licenses, which authorize certain transactions that would otherwise be prohibited by Executive Order 13599. Subject to certain exceptions, General License A authorizes under Executive Order l3599 all transactions involving property and interests in property of the Government of Iran or Iranian financial institutions that are authorized under general licenses set forth in the ITR, including § 560.516. Additionally, General License B authorizes U.S. depository institutions and U.S. registered brokers or dealers in securities to process transfers of funds to or from Iran or for or on behalf of an individual ordinarily resident in Iran who is not included within the term \"Government of Iran\" to the extent the transfer is a noncommercial, personal remittance and the transfer is not by, to, or through a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 544 (\"WMDPSR\"), or the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 594 (\"GTSR\"), or a person whose property and interests in property are blocked· pursuant to any other part of 31 C.F.R. chapter V, or any Executive order, except an Iranian financial institution whose property and interests in property are blocked solely pursuant to Executive Order 13599.  Please be advised that Iran Air has been designated under the WMDPSR. Accordingly, all property and interests in property within the United States, or within the possession or control of any U.S. person, which is owned or controlled by Iran Air, is · blocked. WMDPSR, § 544.201 (a). Additionally, the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of Iran Air, when engaged in by a U.S. person or within the United States, is prohibited. WMDPSR, § 544.201(b). However, transactions that are ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country are exempt from the prohibitions of the WMDPSR. WMDPSR, § 544.206(c).  Please be further advised that Mahan Air has been designated under the GTSR. Accordingly, all property and interests in property within the United States, or within the possession or control of any U.S. person, which is owned or controlled by Mahan Air, is blocked. GTSR, § 594.201(a). Additionally, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transaction or dealing in property or interests in property of Mahan Air, including but not limited to the making or receiving of any contribution of funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of Mahan Air. GTSR, § 594.204. Please note that the exemptions for transactions that are ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country, outlined herein, are not applicable to entities designated under the GTSR.  OFAC's November 2003 Guidance stated that U.S. airlines may generally accept reservations and issue tickets for travel on Iranian carriers, as well as advertise air services between the United States and Iran, pursuant to section 560.210 of the ITR and subject to certain conditions. OFAC further cautioned that the travel exemption set forth in section 560.210 of the ITR applies only to arranging travel and should not be construed to authorize transactions not directly incident to travel, such as the creation or enhancement of a travel reservation service in Iran.  Based on the Information provided in your letter, the GTSR would prohibit U.S. airlines from entering into ITB and SPA agreements with Mahan Air. However, pursuant to the travel exemption outlined above, and consistent with OFAC's November 2003 Guidance, U.S. airlines would generally not be prohibited from entering into ITB and SPA agreements with other Iranian airlines, including Iran Air, to the extent that such agreements are directly incident to international travel to and from Iran. However, in order to make a final determination. OFAC requires additional information on the nature of such ITB and SPA agreements, including: (i) what, if any, other transactions or purchases of goods and services may be included as part of ITB and SPA agreements, such as a customer's purchase of ancillary goods or services from the airlines; (ii) whether purely domestic travel within Iran, as a whole or a part of a customer's itinerary, is covered by ITB and SPA agreements; and (iii) whether any parties other than airlines, such as travel providers, may be partner to ITB and SPA agreements. Please submit the above requested information and reference Case No IA-16194.  If you have any additional questions about the ITR or about the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, you may refer to the OFAC website at www.treasury.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480.  Sincerely,  [Signature] June 12, 2012  Andrea Gacki Assistant Director for Licensing  Office of Foreign Assets Control \n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:   1) Guidance confirms that OFAC does not consider the Berman Amendment IEEPA exemptions (i.e. travel, informational materials) to apply to entities designated under the GTSR, but acknowledges they do apply to entities designated under the WMDPSR (such as Iran Air, which was an NPWMD at the time of the guidance but is not as of 7/2021).  See FAQ 534, and comments thereto, on the legal basis for the application of the Berman exemptions to Iran Air, but not Mahan Air.   2) \"Interline and special prorate agreements with Iranian airlines\" are deemed ordinarily incident to travel, but see JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (2nd violation, Settlement Agreement Component) (2018), which clarifies that settlement payments paid in part pursuant to those agreements cannot include with them anything not exempt from the applicable sanctions regulations, including \"airline freight charges.\" \"Multilateral Proration Agreements\" are entered into with respect to both passenger carriage and cargo, and apparently outside the scope of this guidance. ( See e.g. https://www.iata.org/services/finance/Documents/multilateral-proration-agreement-cargo.pdf).   3) While other guidance clarifies that U.S. persons may avail themselves of the 560.210(d) to facilitate Iranians' travel to third countries, this guidance suggests that the facilitation of purely domestic Iran flights might not be not covered under the exemption (which covers \"travel to or from any country\"). Presumably domestic flights taken by international travelers would still fall within the scope of the exemption, but that is not clear from the guidance.   4) At the time this guidance was issued, Iran Air was designated pursuant to the WMDPSR, such that all significant transactions facilitated for that entity were technically within the scope of 561.201(a)(5)(ii) of the IFSR, allowing for the sanctioning of any FFI that facilitates a significant transaction for an entity designated pursuant to the WMDPSR or GTSR in connection with Iran-related activity. The travel exemption does not apply to the IFSR, but this guidance letter, and the absence of any mention of the secondary sanctions issue, is indicative of OFAC's consistent practice of not applying secondary sanctions in a way that has the effect of undermining IEEPA exemptions. Indeed, OFAC has never (as of 7/2021) designated a non-U.S. person for engaging in activities for which no license would have been required for a U.S. person.   Iran Air’s WMDPSR designation was revoked in 2016, and not reinstated subsequent to the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA (at least as of 7/2021), but it is notable that no secondary sanctions or derivative designations resulted from dealings with Iran Air while it was designated pursuant to the WMDPSR. For general discussion on OFAC's practice in this regard, see General Note on Secondary Sanctions and “Derivative Designation” Criteria; Identification of the Gap Between the Theoretical and Practical Scopes of Authorities Targeting Transactions with no U.S. Nexus; Enforcement Risk Management (System Ed. Note).   5) See Iran-Related Civil Aviation Industry Advisory (2019), and comments thereto, concerning the relationship between primary and secondary sanctions in the aviation industry.   *Note to all letters referencing \"General License B\": General License B to EO 13599 was issued concurrent with the blocking of all Iranian financial institutions. It permitted remittances involving blocked banks other than those blocked pursuant to another part of the CFR (i.e. WMDPSR or GTSR). The reissue of the ITR as the ITSR in October, 2012, incorporated the substance of GL B into the regulations.  ---  Consolidated Comment Concerning OFAC's Reluctance to Issue Binding \"Not Sanctionable\" Secondary Sanctions Determinations  Case No. UKRAINE-EO13662-2018-354836-1 illustrates OFAC’s general policy against issuing binding \"not sanctionable\" determinations as it relates to secondary sanctions and derivative designation criteria in situations where there is not public guidance specifically speaking to the fact pattern in question. Collected notable examples are as follows:  (i)  Case No. IFSR-2014-314645-1 (returning reinsurance premium to non-sanctioned entity in connection with IFSR-designated insured) (ii)  Case No. UKRAINE-EO13661-2015-317467-1 (non-US company engaged in the marketing of items pursuant to trademark licensing agreement with SDN). (iii)  Case No. IA-2018-357507-1 (major European airline flying in and out of Tehran) (iv)  Case No. Ukraine-EO13662-2018-354754-1 (Government of Jamaica activities with blocked bauxite refinery). (v)  Case No. IA-18753 (use of IFSR-designated bank as intermediary to transfer funds) (vi)  Case No. IA-16194 (transactions with IFSR-designated entity) (vii)  Case No. FNK-2016-328825-1, Case No. FNK-2016-328984-1 (transactions outside US jurisdiction involving blocked entities) (viii)  Case No. Ukraine-EO13662-2018-353695-1 (payment of grounding fees to blocked airport operator)  Case No. UKRAINE-EO13662-2018-354836-1, by contrast, is a genuine, rare \"comfort letter\" providing explicit assurances concerning a willingness to not impose \"mandatory\" sanctions in connection with otherwise sanctionable activity.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

The prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to any transactions that are exempt pursuant to section 203(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)). (b)  Official business. The prohibitions contained in § 526.201(a) do not apply to transactions for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes  1) APPLICABILITY OF IEEPA EXEMPTIONS  Compare 588.206 (Western Balkans Stabilization Regulations), another \"exempt transactions\" provision written in this style.  As discussed in at length in General Note on the Applicability of IEEPA/TWEA Exemptions in EOs and Sanctions Regulations not Specifically Mentioning Them, the non-waivable exemptions in section 203(b) of IEEPA apply even where they are not explicitly implemented in regulations, except where the prohibitions implemented are based on an authority (e.g. UNPA / FNKSR) that do not include exemptions. For the years up through the 9-29-22 publication of 553.206 (2022), OFAC had been issuing regulations making no reference to IEEPA exemptions other than the personal communications exemption.  Here, OFAC does not explicitly implement the travel and informational materials exemptions as it had in the past (see e.g. 560.210(c)), but it does, at least, explicitly state that \"[t]he prohibitions contained in this part do not apply to any transactions that are exempt pursuant to section 203(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)).\"  That statement should be read in light of subsection (a), which states that the exemptions \"do not apply to transactions involving property or interests in property of persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the authority of the United Nations Participation Act\". The \"Note 1 to paragraph (a)\" is consistent with OFAC past statements concerning the relationship of IEEPA exemptions and regulations pursuant to which persons are and are not blocked pursuant to UNPA.   2) INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS  The scope of the informational materials exemption applicable here has been interpreted identically across programs. The Research System contains over 100 guidance letters, interpretive rulings, FAQs and other documents addressing the various interpretive issues that have come up with regard to the exemption. Refer to, e.g. Examples of the \"Substantive or Artistic Alteration or Enhancement\" and \"Fully Created and in Existence\" Standards, Notes Common to the \"Information or informational materials\" Definitional Provision, Notable Applications of the Definition of \"Information or Informational Materials\" and Examples of Transactions Exempt as Incident to Underlying Informational Materials Transactions.  3) TRAVEL   a) The scope of the exemption for travel and transactions ordinarily incident thereto been interpreted identically across programs. The Research System contains a multitude of guidance letters, interpretive rulings, FAQs and other documents addressing the various interpretive issues that have come up with regard to the exemption. See Notable Examples Illustrating the scope of the travel Exemption.  4) PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS  The Personal Communications exemption is common across programs, and interpretations of it can be found in the Research System by selecting the \"Key Legal Issues\" search criterion associated with the personal communications exemption. [12-23-23 UPDATE - See Case No. IA-2017-339679-1 (certain \"mentoring\" services provided by a non-profit over the internet through social media are exempt under the IEEPA \"personal communications\" exemption)].   5) DONATIONS/HUMANITARIAN  Some \"Exempt transactions\" provisions allow for transactions of this type. In this case, the President invoked the authority, granted under IEEPA, to decline to apply the exemption for donations.  6) TRANSACTIONS ORDINARILY INCIDENT TO EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS, GENERALLY  To the degree that a transaction is exempt from regulation as a result of an IEEPA-mandated exemption (i.e. personal communications, informational materials, travel, (and sometimes donations)), all transactions incident to the exempt transactions are also, themselves, exempt. See Notes Common to the 400-Level Interpretive Provisions Authorizing Transactions \"Ordinarily Incident\" to a Licensed Transaction; Transactions Incident to Others in General (System Ed. Note). This is true whether or not the underlying transaction involves a U.S. person. See General Note and Associated Matrix Pertaining to U.S. Person Engagement in Transactions Incident to Transactions by Foreign Persons (System Ed. Note).  7) OFFICIAL BUSINESS  Refer to General Note on Exemptions and General Licenses for the \"Official Business\" of the U.S. Government (and/or United Nations) and Employees, Contractors, or Grantees Thereof, for comments on scope of this provision.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

  "answer": "According to [Case No. IA-16194], OFAC’s guidance confirms that U.S. airlines generally may rely on the travel exemption for interline ticketing and baggage (ITB) and special prorate agreements (SPAs) with Iranian carriers when the agreements are directly incident to international travel to or from Iran. In that correspondence, OFAC explained that—so long as the agreements are limited to transactions ordinarily incident to arranging travel (that is, they cover services directly related to facilitating travel such as coordinating reservations, baggage handling, and ticket issuance)—they are exempt from the prohibitions of the Iranian Transactions Regulations. However, the guidance also notes that additional details (for example, whether the agreements include ancillary services, involve purely domestic travel within Iran, or include non–travel-related transactions) must be provided before a final determination is made.\n\nIt is also important to note that while the travel exemption covers arrangements directly incident to facilitating travel (including ITBs and SPAs), it does not cover transactions or services that are not directly related to the travel process. For example, if an agreement were to include services beyond simple facilitation of international travel, those components might fall outside the exemption. Additionally, OFAC’s guidance clarifies that entities designated under certain sanctions programs (such as those designated under the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations) may be excluded from the benefit of this exemption even if the agreements are incident to travel.\n\nIn summary, based on [Case No. IA-16194]:\n • Interline ticketing and baggage and special prorate agreements are generally exempt under the travel exemption provided they are strictly confined to activities directly incident to facilitating international travel.\n • Additional information (e.g., the nature of any ancillary services or domestic-only travel components) is needed to ensure all aspects of the agreements fall within that exemption.\n • The exemption does not apply to transactions involving entities designated under programs (such as the GTSR) that exclude such exemptions.\n\nThis answer is based on the detailed OFAC correspondence in [Case No. IA-16194]."
