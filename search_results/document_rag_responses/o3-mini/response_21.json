The Foreign Assets Control Regulations, to the extent they were promulgated under TWEA authority, are therefore no longer in force with respect to North Korea.  The import and transfer restrictions found at 31 C.F.R. 500.586(b)(2) and (b)(3) were promulgated under other authorities and remain in force.  Also on June 26, 2008, the President issued, under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Executive Order 13466, continuing two of the TWEA-based restrictions against North Korea.  OFAC will issue regulations implementing the Executive order.   Criminal fines for violating the E.O. range, upon conviction, up to $1,000,000; individuals may also face imprisonment up to 20 years.  In addition, civil penalties of up to $250,000 or twice the amount of the underlying transaction may be imposed administratively for each violation.  This fact sheet is a broad summary of the sanctions currently in place.  ACCOUNTS, ASSETS AND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS -  Property and interests in property that were blocked as of June 16, 2000, and that remained blocked immediately prior to June 26, 2008, remain blocked.   TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING NORTH KOREAN VESSELS - U.S. persons are prohibited from registering vessels in North Korea, obtaining authorization for a vessel to fly the North Korean flag, and owning, leasing, operating, or insuring any vessel flagged by North Korea.  BUYING FROM NORTH KOREA - Goods of North Korean origin may not be imported into the United States either directly or through third countries, without prior notification to and approval of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Importers must provide OFAC with written information as to whether the products to be imported were produced by (a) a foreign person designated by the Secretary of State as having engaged in missile technology proliferation activities; (b) an activity of the North Korean Government relating to the development or production of any missile equipment or technology; or (c) an activity of the North Korean Government affecting the development or production of electronics, space systems or equipment, and military aircraft. In addition to the information just described, importers seeking an approval letter from OFAC must provide their name, address, telephone, fax, and e-mail addresses; a description of the product to be imported, including quantity and cost; the name and address of the producer of the product; the name of the location where the product was produced; and the name and address of the North Korean exporter.  Requests for import review must be submitted by mail to North Korea Unit, Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Annex, Washington, DC 20220.  After reviewing the information, OFAC will issue a letter indicating the results of the review to the person seeking to import the product. U.S. depository institutions handling letters of credit or documentary collections involving imports from North Korea must obtain a copy of OFAC's approval letter from the importer before proceeding with such transactions.  The letter must also be provided to the U.S. Customs Service before imports from North Korea will be allowed into the United States.  TRANSFERS FROM NORTH KOREA - U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transfers from the Government of North Korea either (a) that constitute a donation to a U.S. person or (b) with respect to which the U.S. person knows or has reasonable cause to believe the transfer poses a risk of furthering terrorist acts in the United States.  TRAVELING TO NORTH KOREA - U.S. passports are valid for travel to North Korea and individuals do not need U.S. Government permission to travel there.  U.S. persons may also provide travel services for travel to North Korea.  Termination of the Exercise of Authorities Under the Trading with the Enemy Act with Enemy Act with Respect to North Korea  A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America  I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 101(b) of Public Law 95-223 (91 Stat. 1625; 50 U.S.C. App. 5(b) note), hereby find that the continuation of the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1 et seq.) (TWEA) with respect to North Korea, as authorized in Proclamation 2914 of December 16, 1950, most recently continued under Presidential Determination 2007-32 of September 13, 2007 (72 FR 53407), and implemented by the regulations set forth below, is no longer in the national interest of the United States.  Section 1. The exercise of TWEA authorities with respect to North Korea, which were implemented by the Foreign Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 500, and the Transaction Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 505, and that were continued by Presidential Determination 2007-32 of September 13, 2007, is terminated, and Presidential Determination 2007-32 is rescinded with respect to North Korea.  Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to take all appropriate measures within the Secretary's authority to give effect to this proclamation.  Sec. 3. This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.  Sec. 4. This proclamation is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 27, 2008.  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.  GEORGE W. BUSH  EXECUTIVE ORDER 13466:  Continuing Certain Restrictions with Respect to North Korea and North Korean Nationals  By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,       I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that the current existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.  I further find that, as we deal with that threat through multilateral diplomacy, it is necessary to continue certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise be lifted pursuant to a forthcoming proclamation that will terminate the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1 et seq.) (TWEA) with respect to North Korea.       Accordingly, I hereby order:       Section 1.  Except to the extent provided in statutes or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order, the following are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:  all property and interests in property of North Korea or a North Korean national that, pursuant to the President's authorities under the TWEA, the exercise of which has been continued in accordance with section 101(b) of Public Law 95-223 (91 Stat. 1625; 50 U.S.C. App. 5(b) note), were blocked as of June 16, 2000, and remained blocked immediately prior to the date of this order.       Sec. 2.  Except to the extent provided in statutes or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order, United States persons may not register a vessel in North Korea, obtain authorization for a vessel to fly the North Korean flag, or own, lease, operate, or insure any vessel flagged by North Korea.       Sec. 3.  (a)  Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.       (b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.       Sec. 4.  For the purposes of this order:       (a)  the term \"person\" means an individual or entity;       (b)  the term \"entity\" means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and       (c)  the term \"United States person\" means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.       Sec. 5.  The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.  The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law.  All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.       Sec. 6.  The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).       Sec. 7.  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.  GEORGE W. BUSH THE WHITE HOUSE, June 26, 2008.   The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control also administers sanctions programs involving the Balkans, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Diamond Trading, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Sudan, Syria, Zimbabwe as well as highly enriched uranium, designated Terrorists and international Narcotics Traffickers, Foreign Terrorist Organizations and designated foreign persons who have engaged in activities relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Hager  Dear Mr. Hager:  This is in reply to your request dated August 27, 2018, and additional correspondence dated May 28, 2019, June 4, 2019, and February 24, 2020 (collectively, the \"Application\") on behalf of the Asia Foundation (TAF), to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) seeking a specific license to make shipments of donated books to North Korea. The Application states that books are donated to TAF from U.S. publishers under the Books for Asia program. TAF pays a freight forwarder to deliver the books to North Korea, via China, with the ultimate consignee as the Grand People’s Study House. The books are then distributed by North Korean Government Entities as they see fit. Shipments times are established by TAF and UN Mission of the DPRK in New York.  The North Korea Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 510 (NKSR), section 213 exempts the exportation of information or informational materials from the NKSR. The definition of informational materials includes publications, which OFAC interprets to include donated books, see § 510.312. Based upon the information provided in the Application, TAF’s proposed activities related to the exportation of informational materials to the Grand People’s Study House appears to be exempt from the NKSR. To the extent authorization is required, OFAC notes that coordination or partnership with North Korean Government entities is prohibited without a specific license.  Please refer to our website at www.treasury.gov/ofac or call our office at (202) 622-2480 if you have additional questions about any of the U.S. economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC.

Sapp   Chief, Licensing Division Office of Foreign Assets Control\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1)  BACKGROUND:  The Asia Foundation (TAF) is a U.S. person nonprofit that, since 1996, has had a \"Books for Asia program [that] has donated more than 170,000 books and publications to North Korean institutions, including the national library of North Korea, the Grand People’s Study House, and various university libraries, in the areas of science, technology, medicine, economics, English, art, history, international relations, and law. Major donors include McGraw Hill, Lynne Rienner, and W.W. Norton & Company. Books for Asia program has donated more than 170,000 books and publications to North Korean institutions, including the national library of North Korea, the Grand People’s Study House, and various university libraries, in the areas of science, technology, medicine, economics, English, art, history, international relations, and law. Major donors include McGraw Hill, Lynne Rienner, and W.W. Norton & Company.\" (See https://web.archive.org/web/20230205172403/https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Korea_Overview_2017.pdf). The \"Grand People’s Study House\" is a public (i.e. government-run) library in North Korea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_People%27s_Study_House).   2)  TAF seeks \"a specific license to make shipments of donated books to North Korea,\" which it exports to North Korea by paying \"a freight forwarder to deliver the books to North Korea, via China, with the ultimate consignee as the Grand People’s Study House,\" with \"[s]hipment[] times are established by TAF and UN Mission of the DPRK in New York.\" At the time the guidance letter was issued, and still as of 3-3-24, the Government of North Korea is blocked pursuant to 510.201, and there is a broad export prohibition at 510.205. Those prohibitions do not apply with respect to persons \"blocked pursuant to the authority of the United Nations Participation Act\" (510.213), but the Government of North Korea is not, as a whole, blocked pursuant to UNPA.   3)  Books as Exempt  OFAC regards these activities as exempt. Given the breadth of the term \"information and informational materials,\" it comes as no surprise that \"OFAC interprets\" the terms \"information and informational materials\" (and more specifically \"publications\") to \"include donated books\". Compare generally Notable Applications of the Definition of \"Information or Informational Materials\".   4)  Exempt Transactions Incident to the Exports / Coordination and \"Partnerships\"  What is more significant here are the transactions incident to the donation of the books that OFAC regards as exempt. First is the \"pay[ment of] a freight forwarder to deliver the books to North Korea, via China, with the ultimate consignee as the Grand People’s Study House\". That shipments (and paying for) shipments of exempt informational materials is itself exempt is consistent with OFAC’s past practice. See Examples of Transactions Exempt as Incident to Underlying Informational Materials Transactions.  More notable is that TAF establishes shipment times  with the \"UN Mission of the DPRK in New York\". As of 3-3-24, this appears to be the only item in the Research System confirming that pre-shipment coordination with blocked persons in connection with exempt exports is itself exempt from regulation. Note that OFAC says \"[t]o the extent authorization is required, OFAC notes that coordination or partnership with North Korean Government entities is prohibited without a specific license.\" This appears aimed at conveying that, in circumstances where \"coordination or partnership\" is not sufficiently related to an underlying exempt transaction such that the \"coordination or partnership\" is itself exempt, this is something that rises to the level of a \"service\" provided to or received from a blocked person / North Korea such that it is prohibited conduct. (Compare Notable Examples of Activities That Do and to Not Constitute a \"Service\" for the Purposes of OFAC’s Regulations (System Ed. Note)). Note that the status of \"partnerships or partnership agreements\" with the Government of North Korea was later addressed in 510.512(d)(2), in which OFAC implies that \"partnerships or partnership agreements with\" Government of North Korea entities could be authorized by a GL authorizing the exportation of certain items to North Korea.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

(a) The exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a U.S. person, wherever located, of any goods, services, or technology to North Korea is prohibited. (b) The prohibitions in this section apply except to the extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this part or pursuant to the export control authorities implemented by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date.\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:   1) With the exception of 510.206(b), which is unique to the NKSR, this IEEPA-based export ban is, for practical purposes and as a general matter, extremely similar to the analogous provision of the ITSR (560.204). Given that 560.204 is arguably the single most frequently interpreted and enforced provision in the entirety of OFAC's sanctions regulations, one should look to the interpretations of that provision for guidance on the manner in which OFAC is likely to interpret this provision. Note that 510.405, interpreting the export ban, is substantively identical with the ITSR analogue, 560.410. Refer to Notes Common to “Provision of services” Interpretive Provisions (System Ed. Note).   With respect to the significance of 510.206(b), as a provision that appears to serve as a quasi-exemption from OFAC's jurisdiction for certain exports subject to the EAR but not prohibited for export to North Korea, refer to General Comment on the Relationship Between the North Korea Sanctions Regulations and Export Controls Administered by the Dep’t of Commerce (System Ed. Note). [2-16-24 Update – the implementation of 510.520 largely renders System Note irrelevant for practical compliance purposes. See comments to 510.520, and note that this comment has not been updated to reflect the implementation into the NKSR of 510.520]  On their faces, 560.204 differs significantly from 510.206(a) in two ways. First, the \"reason to know\" standard for transshipments is not explicit in the NKSR, and second, there is no equivalent in the NKSR of 560.204(b), dealing with prohibiting exports of \"goods, technology, or services [] intended specifically for use in the production of, for commingling with, or for incorporation into goods, technology, or services to be directly or indirectly supplied, transshipped, or reexported exclusively or predominantly to Iran or the Government of Iran.\"  As discussed in more detail in the comments to 560.204, neither of the above omissions from this provision are likely to result in substantial practical differences in the scopes of the provisions. 560.204(b) acts, fundamentally, as an interpretation of the scope of the export prohibition language that is included in this provision, which is consistent with OFAC's longstanding practices, and OFAC is likely to interpret the NKSR version in the same manner. Similarly, OFAC issued guidance interpreting 560.204(a) as encompassing situations in which an export is made to a third-country company whose business is \"predominantly\" with Iran. That interpretation should also be presumed to apply here. Refer generally to General Note on \"Indirect Financing,\" or Investments in Third Country Companies that do Business with Sanctioned Parties (System Ed. Note).  Similarly, the \"reason to know\" provision acts as a sort of safe harbor, and that safe harbor was helpful to a fined exporter in Epsilon Electronics, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, 857 F.3d 913 (D.C. Cir. 2017), but in practice OFAC applies the \"reason to know\" standard cross-programmatically, and with respect to all violations, even when the scope of the prohibition does not explicitly include a knowledge qualifier. See General Note on the terms \"knowingly,\" \"should have known\" and \"reason to know\" in the Primary Sanctions, Secondary Sanctions and Derivative Designation Contexts (System Ed. Note).  2) EXPORTS OF \"TECHNOLOGY\"  With respect to exports of \"technology,\" refer to 560.418  (Release of technology or software in the United States or a third country), and comments thereto. That is the only meaningful guidance provided, in any program, on the scope of the 200-level prohibition pertaining to exports of \"technology\" as something distinct from goods and services. This essentially means that no \"technology\" subject to the EAR may be released, i.e. in the context of a \"deemed export,\" to any person ordinarily resident in the sanctioned country. One would expect OFAC to consider the term \"services\" to extend far enough to cover all or virtually all releases of technology to sanctioned persons, but the EAR's \"deemed export\" rules could be considered to cover certain inadvertent releases of technology that might fall outside the scope of what are otherwise provisions of services. Note that, from 2006-5/2019, there have been no OFAC enforcement actions pertaining to the export of \"technology.\"  3) MEANING OF \"NORTH KOREA\"  There is no regulatory definition of \"North Korea\", but see Enforcement Release: British American Tobacco p.l.c. (OFAC considering a North Korean embassy outside of North Korea to constitute \"North Korea\" for the purposes of this provision).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

The scope of the provision does not appear to have been the subject of any notable interpretive guidance.    Note that the TSR version, and only the TSR version, has a note specifying that legitimate donors will not be subject to penalties unless they have \"knowledge or reason to know\" about blocked person involvement in a given donation. That statement merely restates OFAC's default practice. See \"General Note on the Terms \"Knowingly,\" \"Should Have Known\" And \"Reason to Know\"  In the Primary Sanctions, Secondary Sanctions and Derivative Designation Contexts (System Ed. Note).  2) APPLICABILITY ONLY TO BLOCKED PERSONS; THE MEANING OF \"UNLESS SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED\"  In the case of the NKSR, which covers transactions with blocked persons and all non-blocked persons \"ordinarily resident\" in North Korea, the fact that this provision is written in the style of the typical boilerplate \"charitable contributions\" provision may prove misleading. This provision specifically excludes donations of both funds and articles to blocked persons. It is intuitive that this would be clarified in the case of embargoes in which donations of articles to non-blocked citizens are exempt. But unlike, for example, the ITSR, there is no explicit exemption in the NKSR permitting donations of articles for persons that are not blocked (compare 560.210(b)), the NKSR's \"exempt transactions\" provision is silent on the question the applicability of the IEEPA exemption for \"donations.\" The EOs that the NKSR implement are vague as to whether the exclusions to the donation provision were meant to apply even to non-blocked citizens. Executive Order 13722 of March 15, 2016, which is the source of the broad-based \"export ban\" to North Korea, contains both that broad based ban (Sec. 3) as well as blocking provisions for particular individuals and entities (Secs. 1 and 2). The exclusion for IEEPA-based donation exemption (Sec. 5) appears aimed only at Secs. 1 and 2, rather than 3 (contrast Sec. 5 of EO 13338 of May 11, 2004 concerning Syria, in which is clear that the exclusion of the donation exemption applies irrespective of the recipient). This could mean that the donation of \"articles\" to relieve human suffering, and transactions ordinarily incident thereto, are exempt from regulation in the NKSR.  Both the NKSR generally and the EO excluding donations do contain a reference to UNPA [1] as part of the authority for the sanctions, but that does not fully explain why any reference to donations is missing from the NKSR, since the distinction is made between blocked parties (designated under the authority of UNPA and IEEPA) and non-blocked parties (where prohibitions apply only as a result of IEEPA) in the case of the other Berman Amendment exemptions. Instead the NKSR suggest that IEEPA exemption for donations of articles is inapplicable altogether, rather than only inapplicable as it relates to blocked persons, as is the case with the ITSR. Given the level detail of the NKSR generally, one should assume that, unlike abbreviated sanctions programs in which the IEEPA exemptions are not explicitly in the regulations but apply directly from the applicable EO, OFAC is taking the position that all donations of anything to North Korea must fall within the scope of one of 510.511 or 510.512 [2].    Complicating matters on this front is that the IEEPA exemption for donations covers the donation of \"articles,\" which are, when exported from the U.S., presumed to be subject to the EAR. See General Comment on the Relationship Between the North Korea Sanctions Regulations and Export Controls Administered by the Dep’t of Commerce (System Ed. Note). Exports of EAR99 food and medicine are outside of OFAC's jurisdiction altogether, as are transactions ordinarily incident to such exports. It is possible that this had an impact on the decision to address the IEEPA exemption for donations in the NKSR. [2-16-24 Update – the implementation of 510.520 largely renders System Note irrelevant for practical compliance purposes. See comments to 510.520, and note that this comment has not been updated to reflect the implementation into the NKSR of 510.520].  Finally, note that donations of EAR9 food and medicine to the North Korean Government are outside the scope of OFAC's jurisdiction--at least when they are sent to persons other than SDNs--even though the government is blocked pursuant to 510.201(a). It would appear that, by using the words \"[u]nless specifically authorized by OFAC\" in reference to all donations of goods to persons blocked pursuant to 510.201, OFAC considers an export falling within the scope of 510.206(b) to constitute an \"authorization\" by OFAC for the export. This is not an explicit assertation of jurisdiction over such exports, as would be the case if OFAC referred to such exports as being \"licensed.\"  [1] Recall that UNPA contains no Berman Amendment-style exemptions.  [2] The NKSR contain i) a remittance GL for funds to non-blocked North Koreans (510.511), and ii) a GL permitting donations and other activities through nongovernmental organizations (510.512).   3) REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION CONCERNING \"INDIRECT\" DEALINGS WITH ENTITIES MERELY \"CONTROLLED\" BY BLOCKED PERSONS  Apart from the fact that the provision specifies that contributions of funds, goods or services include non-commercial charitable contributions, the boilerplate \"charitable contributions\" provision is notable for the fact that it extends to contributions made to persons \"owned or controlled by\" blocked persons. In this regard, the treatment of \"charitable contributions\" is treated in a manner that is even more strict than commercial dealings with non-blocked persons that are controlled, but not necessarily owned, by blocked persons. In the context of a commercial transaction with a person that is \"controlled\" by a blocked person but not otherwise blocked itself, it is prohibited to engage in an \"indirect\" transaction with a blocked person through the non-blocked entity, but there is no presumption that a commercial transaction with a non-blocked entity controlled by a blocked person is necessarily \"for the benefit\" of the blocked person. See e.g. Case No. BEL-147, issued in 2012. OFAC explicitly stated the following, in the context of the interpretation of a basic blocking prohibition (548.201) that was, at the time the letter was issued, complimented by a standard \"charitable contributions\" provision (548.408). The letter provided as follows:  U.S. persons are advised to act with caution when engaging in a transaction with an entity in which a blocked person has a significant ownership interest that is less than 50% or which a blocked person may control by means other than a majority ownership interest. Furthermore a U.S. person may not procure or provide goods, services, or technology from or to a blocked person through a third-party intermediary.  The context of that letter was a question of whether a U.S. person could export goods to an entity in which a blocked entity was heavily invested, and over which a blocked person may have exercised effective control. It was not the case that the entity was effectively blocked on the basis of a presumption that control would mean that all dealings with the entity in question were \"indirect\" dealings with the blocked entity. This is not the case with respect to charitable contributions, which are irrebuttably presumed to be for the benefit of the blocked entity that controls the entity receiving the contribution. In all probability, one could expect OFAC to treat all non-commercial dealings with entities controlled by blocked persons with a high degree of suspicion. This is the case whether or not they are ostensibly for \"charitable\" purposes.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Are news reporting organizations and journalists authorized to conduct activities in North Korea?   The general license at § 510.522 of the North Korea Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 510 (NKSR), authorizes news reporting organizations that are U.S. persons, and their U.S. person employees to engage in certain transactions in North Korea, provided that such transactions are ordinarily incident and necessary to their journalistic activities or the establishment or operation of a news bureau in North Korea.  The authorized activities include: hiring and compensating support staff, logistics personnel, or other office personnel as needed; leasing or renting office space; renting and using telecommunications facilities; and, under certain conditions, exporting and reexporting to North Korea, and subsequently reexporting from North Korea, equipment that is not subject to the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 774) (EAR).  Exports and reexports of items that are subject to the EAR must be authorized pursuant to a license or license exception (for example, License Exception TMP) issued by BIS.  While certain transactions ordinarily incident to travel and certain exports and imports of information and informational materials are exempt under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1702(b) (IEEPA), these exemptions do not apply to transactions prohibited pursuant to the United Nations Participation Act.  Moreover, as of September 1, 2017, U.S. passports are invalid for travel into, in, or through North Korea. However, in limited circumstances, applicants may be eligible for a Special Validation Passport from the State Department that will allow them to travel for specific purposes. See travel.state.gov for additional details.  Date Updated: February 15, 2024  Date Released March 1, 2018  **  558. Are news reporting organizations and journalists authorized to conduct activities in North Korea?   News reporting organizations do not require OFAC authorization to engage in activities that are exempt pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1702(b), such as travel to or from any country or the importation or exportation of informational materials.  All other activities would require a specific license from OFAC.  For example, it is prohibited for journalists to employ North Korean government guides or purchase North Korean-origin technology without a specific license.  The exemptions contained in IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. § 1702(b), do not apply to transactions involving persons blocked by the United Nations pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolutions.  As of September 1, 2017, U.S. passports are invalid for travel into, in, or through North Korea.  However, in limited circumstances, applicants may be eligible for a Special Validation Passport from the State Department that will allow them to travel for specific purposes.  See travel.state.gov for for additional details. [03-01-2018]\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) Prior to 2-15-24, when there was no \"news bureaus\" GL in the NKSR, this FAQ (see original version at bottom left) was aimed at explaining that certain news-related activities (e.g. travel and informational materials transaction) were exempt from regulation, but that the exemption did not apply to \"employ[ing] North Korean government guides or purchas[ing] North Korean-origin technology\".   2) On 2-15-24, OFAC added 510.522, which is a version of OFAC’s standard \"news bureaus\" GL. See 510.522 and comments thereto. This amended version of the FAQ preserves some commentary on the IEEPA exemptions with the added note that they \"do not apply to transactions prohibited pursuant to the United Nations Participation Act\" (see 510.213(a)).   3) OFAC says \"Exports and reexports of items that are subject to the EAR must be authorized pursuant to a license or license exception (for example, License Exception TMP) issued by BIS.\" This is, implicitly, an interpretation of 510.520, which provides that \"All transactions ordinarily incident to the exportation or reexportation of items (commodities, software, or technology) to North Korea, including transactions with the Government of North Korea or any other person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 510.201, and services provided outside North Korea to install, repair, or replace such items, are authorized, provided that the exportation or reexportation of such items to North Korea is licensed or otherwise authorized by the Department of Commerce.\" The term \"licensed or otherwise authorized\" includes items covered by self-executing license exceptions.   4) The notes below refer to the version of this FAQ as it existed prior to 2-15-24. Those notes have not been amended in light of the 2-15-24 amendment to the FAQ.   ---  Notes:  1) The exemption for travel in IEEPA that OFAC refers to provides that \"[t]he authority granted to the President... not include the authority to regulate or prohibit, directly or indirectly...any transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from any country.\"  Here, however, OFAC looks as if it is impliedly asserting that the employment of government guides is not \"ordinarily incident to travel.\" Reportedly, travel in North Korea requires the presence of \"guides,\" or state-employed chaperones, at all times.   Query whether this FAQ is essentially saying that, even if an American obtains a validated passport for travel to North Korea, a specific license is effectively required in order to travel there, given the system requiring the \"employment\" of government-sponsored guides. If so, this policy would seem to amount to the sort of \"indirect\" regulation of transactions \"ordinarily incident\" to travel to North Korea that is outside of OFAC's regulatory authority. Potentially, OFAC would justify this policy as within the scope of IEEPA by arguing that there is nothing \"ordinary\" about the government chaperone system, and it is therefore within OFAC's regulatory authority even if OFAC's policy effectively regulates all travel to North Korea [1]. It seems more likely, however, that OFAC is only referring to the direct \"employment\" of guides, rather than the acquiescing to the assignment of such guides by the North Korean government. Compare FAQ # 348, stating that \"GL D-1 does not authorize the employment of persons in Iran to facilitate sales, the maintenance of a physical sales presence in Iran, or the utilization of Iranian marketing services\" in connection with licensed sales of items to Iran. One may not \"employ\" such persons, but there is nothing to suggest that, for example, paying a commission to an Iranian broker in connection with sales is not \"ordinarily incident\" to a licensed export.  [1] See e.g. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tourists-share-bizarre-experiences-of-north-korea-a6713206.html   2) The FAQ is notable as confirmation that the travel exemption is not merely limited to personal travel. The ITSR contains general licenses for journalistic activities in Iran, but the GL is not there to imply that some such activities are not within the scope of the travel exemption at 560.210(d); instead the GL is there to permit activities above and beyond that which the travel exemption allows for.  3) The language in the FAQ is notable as it relates to the relationship between UNPA and IEEPA exemptions - OFAC says that \"exemptions contained in IEEPA [ ] do not apply to transactions involving persons blocked by the United Nations pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolutions.\" (Emphasis added).  4) Query: when a USP travels to an embargoed destination to engage in transactions that are exempt from regulation, e.g. tourist travel, does this mean that the USP must cut off all work-related communications involving the U.S. (e.g. drafting emails and handling calls)? None of OFAC's travel-related guidance suggests that this is the case. This FAQ is notable on the question because it explicitly envisages USPs traveling to North Korea in their professional capacities to engage in transactions (e.g. export or import of informational materials) that would presumably be in furtherance of their professions. If OFAC's view was that U.S. \"reporting organizations and journalists\" present in North Korea were prohibited from conducting ordinary business with their U.S. counterparties while present in North Korea, one would imagine that OFAC would have provided some notice as to this position (either in this FAQ or somewhere else). See also Case No. IA-16053 (USP traveling in Iran can, provided not ordinarily resident in Iran, \"conduct certain transactions, including electronic bill payments to U.S. parties, electronic transfers of funds between [the individual's] U.S. accounts\".\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Can nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) provide assistance to North Korea? If so, what types of assistance can NGOs provide? Can NGOs conduct transactions with the Government of North Korea?   Yes. Section 510.512(a) of the North Korea Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 510 (NKSR), authorizes NGOs that have filed the report specified in § 510.512 to conduct transactions that are ordinarily incident and necessary to the following activities: 1.  activities to support humanitarian projects to meet basic human needs, including disaster, drought, or flood relief; food, nutrition, or medicine distribution; the provision of health services; assistance for vulnerable or displaced populations, including individuals with disabilities and the elderly; and environmental programs and (the foregoing activities continue to include the distribution of clean water, bottled drinking water, and clothing, and provision of shelter);   2.  activities to support democracy building, including rule of law, citizen participation, government accountability, universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, access to information, and civil society development projects; 3.  activities to support education at or below a secondary school level, including combating illiteracy, increasing access to education at the primary or secondary school level, and assisting education reform projects, provided that such education excludes the subjects of math, sciences, technology, engineering, and computer programming; 4.  activities to support non-commercial development projects directly benefiting civilians, including those related to health, food security, and water and sanitation;   5.  activities to support environmental and natural resource protection, including the preservation and protection of threatened or endangered species, responsible and transparent management of natural resources, and the remediation of pollution or other environmental damage; and 6.  activities to support disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) programs and peacebuilding, conflict prevent, and conflict resolution programs. Such ordinarily incident and necessary transactions may include payment of reasonable and customary taxes, fees, and import duties to, and purchase of receipt of permits, licenses, or public utility services from the Government of North Korea. In addition, for items that are not subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), § 510.512(a) authorizes the export or reexport of items ordinarily incident and necessary to the activities described above, provided the items would be designated as EAR99 if located in the United States.  For more information about OFAC and Commerce licensing requirements relating to the export or reexport of items that are subject to the EAR to North Korea, please see FAQ 459. In most instances, exporters or reexporters no longer need to obtain licenses from both the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and OFAC to engage in transactions related to the export or reexport of items to persons blocked pursuant to the NKSR.  Section 510.520 authorizes transactions that are ordinarily incident to the exportation or reexportation of items to North Korea if the exportation or reexportation of such items is authorized by BIS.  Authorization from BIS is required to export or reexport any item subject to the EAR to North Korea, except food and medicine classified as EAR99 (see also the general license § 510.521 for transactions related to the exportation or reexportation of qualifying food and medicine to North Korea that are not subject to the EAR). Additionally, § 510.512(c) explicitly authorizes U.S. depository institutions, U.S.-registered brokers or dealers in securities, and U.S.-registered money transmitters to process transfers of funds on behalf of U.S. or third-country NGOs, including to or from North Korea, in support of the activities described above.  Date Updated: February 15, 2024    Date Released March 1, 2018   --  463. Can nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) provide assistance to North Korea? If so, what types of assistance can NGOs provide? Can NGOs conduct transactions with the Government of North Korea?  Yes. Section 510.512(a) of the North Korea Sanctions Regulations authorizes NGOs to export or reexport services to North Korea that would otherwise be prohibited in support of the following activities: (1) activities to support humanitarian projects to meet basic human needs in North Korea, including drought, flood, and disaster relief; the distribution of food, medicine, and clothing intended to be used to relieve human suffering; the provision of shelter; the provision of clean water, sanitation, and hygiene assistance; the provision of health-related services; assistance for individuals with disabilities; and environmental programs; (2) activities to support democracy building in North Korea, including rule of law, citizen participation, government accountability, universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, access to information, and civil society development projects; (3) activities to support non-commercial development projects directly benefiting the North Korean people, including preventing infectious disease and promoting maternal/child health, sustainable agriculture, and clean water assistance; and (4) activities to support environmental protection, including the preservation and protection of threatened or endangered species and the remediation of pollution or other environmental damage. Additionally, section 510.512(c) authorizes U.S. depository institutions, U.S.-registered brokers or dealers in securities, and U.S.-registered money transmitters to process transfers of funds on behalf of U.S. or third-country NGOs, including to or from North Korea, in support of the activities identified above.  In most instances, to export or reexport goods, services, or technology to designated individuals and entities, U.S. persons must obtain a license from both OFAC and the Bureau of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce (BIS). A license from BIS is required to export or reexport any item subject to the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 744) (EAR) to North Korea, except food and medicine classified as EAR99. Section 510.512(b) authorizes NGOs to export or reexport from a third country to North Korea food and medicine in support of the activities listed above, provided that the food and medicine are not subject to the EAR. The exportation or reexportation by a U.S. person to North Korea from a third country of items that are not subject to the EAR and that are not food or medicine requires a specific license from OFAC.  Section 510.512(d) authorizes NGOs to conduct limited transactions with the Government of North Korea that are necessary for the above-described activities, such as payment of reasonable and customary taxes and other fees. Partnerships and partnership agreements between NGOs and the Government of North Korea or other blocked persons that are necessary for NGOs to provide authorized services are not permitted without a specific license from OFAC.

See General Note on the North Korea Sanctions Regulations and the Relationships Between the Authorities Underlying the Regulations (System Ed. Note).

Does the general license for non-governmental organization (NGO) activities at section 510.512 of the North Korea Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 510 (NKSR), authorize NGOs to engage in transactions involving the Government of North Korea?    Yes, subject to certain conditions and limitations.  NGOs may engage in transactions with the Government of North Korea to the extent ordinarily incident and necessary to the activities authorized by § 510.512(a).

For example, NGOs may engage with North Korea’s Ministry of Public Health to provide assistance to clean water projects; with customs officials to import humanitarian-related items into the country; and with local jurisdictions, such as city governments and hospitals, to provide food and medical devices.  However, this general license does not authorize the exportation or reexportation of services to, charitable donations to or for the benefit of, or any other transactions involving, the Government of North Korea, the Workers’ Party of Korea, or any other person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the NKSR, except as ordinarily incident and necessary to an activity authorized pursuant to § 510.512(a).

Now that the Government of North Korea is blocked, and all imports of services are prohibited, much of what is prohibited here is also prohibited by 510.201 and/or 510.205.  2) This prohibition only applies on its face to U.S. persons, but note the secondary sanctions risk involved with virtually anything related to North Korean entities involved in the shipping industry, including those involved with the flagging of vessels. [1]  3) Query whether OFAC would consider any vessel flagged (but not owned or operated) by North Korea (or any other blocked person) to be \"property\" in which that Government has an \"interest.\" If so, then this provision substantially understates the extent to which North Korean-flagged vessels are off limits to U.S. persons, because simply having goods shipped on blocked vessels constituted \"dealing\" in property in which the blocked person has an interest. See e.g. Civil Enforcement Information - Grand Resources USA, Inc. (d/b/a GR-Duratech Texas, Inc.) (2012). Foreign Assets Control Regulations and the Insurance Industry (brochure) (2012) is useful in this respect.   4) See related guidance: North Korea Sanctions Advisory (February 23, 2018)  [1] https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2594.aspx  5) Relevant enforcement action: Civil Enforcement Information - Navigators Insurance Company (2015).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

      "content": "=== TITLE ===\nNorth Korea Sanctions & Enforcement Actions Advisory : Risks for Businesses with Supply Chain Links to North Korea\n=== END TITLE ===\n\n=== DOCUMENT TEXT ===\nNorth Korea Sanctions & Enforcement Actions Advisory  Issued:  July 23, 2018  Title:  Risks for Businesses with Supply Chain Links to North Korea  The U.S. Department of State, with the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is issuing this advisory to highlight sanctions evasions tactics used by North Korea that could expose businesses – including manufacturers, buyers, and service providers – to sanctions compliance risks under U.S. and/or United Nations sanctions authorities. This advisory also assists businesses in complying with the requirements under Title III, the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).  Businesses should be aware of deceptive practices employed by North Korea in order to implement effective due diligence policies, procedures, and internal controls to ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements across their entire supply chains.  Multiple U.S. and UN sanctions impose restrictions on trade with North Korea and the use of North Korean labor.[1] The two primary risks are: (1) inadvertent sourcing of goods, services, or technology from North Korea; and (2) the presence of North Korean citizens or nationals in companies’ supply chains, whose labor generates revenue for the North Korean government. This advisory also provides due diligence references for businesses.  North Korea’s system of forced labor operates both domestically and internationally. In North Korea, most laborers work between 12 and 16 hours per day (and sometimes up to 20 hours per day) with only one or two rest days per month in jobs they are assigned to by the North Korean government. Outside of North Korea, there are two primary groups of North Korean laborers earning income: (1) North Korean overseas laborers whose primary work is organized, managed, and overseen by, and produces revenue for, the North Korean government; and (2) North Koreans who have fled North Korea, including refugees and asylum seekers who live and work outside of North Korea and are earning income to sustain themselves in a personal capacity.  The U.S. government is focusing its disruption efforts on North Korean citizens or nationals whose labor generates revenue for the North Korean government. In most cases, employers pay salaries directly to the North Korean government, which takes between 70 percent and 90 percent of the total earnings. The North Korean government reportedly earns hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars per year from exporting labor. These remittances support the North Korean government’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. Use of North Korean citizens or nationals as laborers in supply chains could trigger U.S. sanctions, and the issuance of work authorizations for these North Korean nationals is prohibited under UN Security Council resolution 2397 (2017).  The U.S. government is not seeking to disrupt the efforts of North Korean refugees and asylum seekers, who are living and working outside of North Korea, to earn an income to sustain themselves in a personal capacity. Individuals originally from North Korea, who obtain South Korean citizenship or any other citizenship, are no longer considered North Korean citizens or nationals, for purposes of CAATSA § 321 (b).  I.  Heightened Risk for and Potential Indicators of Goods, Services, and Technology with a North Korean Nexus  •  Sub-Contracting/Consignment Firms: Third-country suppliers shift manufacturing or sub-contracting work to a North Korean factory without informing the customer or other relevant parties. For example, a Chinese factory sub-contracts with a North Korean firm to provide embroidery detailing on an order of garments.  •  Mislabeled Good/Services/Technology: North Korean exporters disguise the origin of goods produced in North Korea by affixing country-of-origin labels that identify a third country. For example, North Korean seafood is smuggled into third countries where it is processed, packaged, and sold without being identified as originating from North Korea. There are also cases in which garments manufactured in North Korea are affixed with \"Made in China\" labels.  •  Joint Ventures: North Korean firms have established hundreds of joint ventures with partners from China and other countries in various industries, such as apparel, construction, small electronics, hospitality, minerals, precious metals, seafood, and textiles. See Annex 2 for a list of known North Korean joint ventures.  •  Raw Materials or Goods Provided with Artificially Low Prices: North Korean exporters sell goods and raw materials well below market prices to intermediaries and other traders, which provides a commercial incentive for the purchase of North Korean goods. This practice has been documented in the export of minerals. For example, a close review of trade data on North Korea’s export of anthracite coal to China from 2014- 2017 reveals a consistent sub-market price for this export.  •  Information Technology (IT) Services: North Korea sells a range of IT services and products abroad, including website and app development, security software, and biometric identification software that have military and law enforcement applications. North Korean firms disguise their footprint through a variety of tactics including the use of front companies, aliases, and third country nationals who act as facilitators. For example, there are cases where North Korean companies exploit the anonymity provided by freelancing websites to sell their IT services to unwitting buyers.  II.  Heightened Risk for and Potential Indicators of North Korean Overseas Labor  A.  Heightened Risk for North Korean Overseas Labor Producing Revenue for the Government of North Korea  Industries  The North Korean government exports large numbers of laborers to fulfill a single contract in various industries, including but not limited to apparel, construction, footwear manufacturing, hospitality, IT services, logging, medical, pharmaceuticals, restaurant, seafood processing, textiles, and shipbuilding.  Location  In 2017-18, North Korean laborers working on behalf of the North Korean government were present in the listed countries and jurisdictions below.2 China and Russia continue to host more North Korean laborers than all other countries and jurisdictions combined.    •  Algeria •  Angola •  Bahrain •  Bangladesh •  Belarus •  Cambodia •  China •  Democratic Republic of the Congo •  Equatorial Guinea •  Ethiopia •  Ghana •  Guinea •  Indonesia •  Kyrgyzstan •  Kuwait •  Laos •  Libya •  Mali •  Malaysia •  Mongolia •  Mozambique •  Namibia •  Nepal •  Nigeria •  Oman •  Peru •  Poland •  Qatar •  Republic of Congo •  Russia •  Rwanda •  Senegal •  Singapore •  Tanzania •  Taiwan •  Thailand •  Uganda •  United Arab Emirates •  Uruguay •  Vietnam •  Zambia •  Zimbabwe   B.  Potential Indicators of North Korean Overseas Labor[3]  •  Wages: Indicators include the employer withholding wages, making unreasonable pay deductions, paying wages late, and making in-kind payments. In some instances, laborers earning revenue for the government are paid wages in cash and pay a lump sum to the North Korean government upon their return home.  •  Contracts: Laborers producing revenue for the government typically are hired under two-to-five year contracts that require a large upfront payment to the North Korean government (anecdotally, up to 30 percent of the total contract amount).  •  Housing: Laborers often reside in unsafe and unsanitary conditions provided by the employer and sometimes face excessive costs for those accommodations. Laborers providing revenue for the government typically reside in collective housing and are isolated from laborers of other nationalities.  •  Control over Laborers: Laborers often have no access to or control over bank accounts. Employers retain passports and/or confiscate or destroy laborers’ personal documents (e.g. visas). Laborers producing revenue for the North Korean government will generally have official documentation, including government-issued passports (as opposed to refugees and asylum seekers who will likely not have any such documentation). As with many victims of forced labor, these documents – as well as visas and work permits – may be retained by employers or recruiters. Laborers providing revenue for the government also get little to no time off and are required to attend mandatory self-criticism sessions.  •  Lack of Transparency: Contract details are often hidden, and financial transactions are handled in such a way that it is difficult to determine the ultimate beneficiary. North Korea also often limits third parties from conducting worksite inspections. Laborers producing revenue for the North Korean government typically cannot be interviewed without a \"minder\" present.  III.  Due Diligence Best Practices Businesses should closely examine their entire supply chain(s) for North Korean laborers and goods, services, or technology, and adopt appropriate due diligence best practices. This especially applies to those businesses with operations in high-risk countries, or who operate in high-risk industries. While due diligence practices will vary based on the size and nature of the business, well-documented due diligence policies and practices may be considered mitigating factors when the U.S. government determines the appropriate enforcement response. For specific recommendations of due diligence practices and potential mitigating factors, please see DHS Q&A, specifically question eight, and OFAC’s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R Part 501, Appendix A.  IV.  Penalties for Violations of Sanctions and Enforcement Actions Individuals and entities should be aware of the potential consequences for engaging in or facilitating prohibited or sanctionable conduct.  OFAC investigates apparent violations of its regulations and maintains enforcement authority as outlined in its Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R Part 501, Appendix A. Persons who violate U.S. sanctions with respect to North Korea can be subject to civil monetary penalties equal to the greater of twice the value of the underlying transaction or $295,141 per violation, referred for criminal prosecution, or both.4 For additional information regarding OFAC’s enforcement authorities, Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, and recent civil penalties and enforcement actions, visit the OFAC Resource Center.  CBP and ICE enforce the prohibition against importing goods made with forced labor through civil and criminal enforcement actions, respectively. Where CBP finds evidence of prohibited North Korean labor, CBP will deny entry of the goods, which could lead to the issuance of civil penalties, and the seizure and forfeiture of the associated goods, as appropriate. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations works with CBP on these types of enforcement actions and may initiate criminal investigations relating to the importation of these proscribed goods that target individuals and/or corporations for their roles in the importation of proscribed goods into the United States in violation of the law. These laws include, but are not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1761, 18 U.S.C. 545, and 18 U.S.C. 1589, and conviction under these laws could result in incarceration, fines, and forfeiture of any/all goods imported and proceeds of these crimes.  V.  Activities that Could Result in Designation by OFAC OFAC has authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to, among other things: •  operate in the construction, energy, financial services, fishing, information technology, manufacturing, medical, mining, textiles, or transportation industries in North Korea; •  have engaged in at least one significant importation from or exportation to North Korea of any goods, services, or technology; •  have engaged in, facilitated, or been responsible for an abuse or violation of human rights by the government of North Korea or the Workers’ Party of Korea or any person acting for or on behalf of either such entity; •  have engaged in, facilitated, or been responsible for the exportation of laborers from North Korea, including exportation to generate revenue for the government of North Korea or the Workers’ Party of Korea; or •  have sold, supplied, transferred, or purchased, directly or indirectly, to or from North Korea or any person acting for or on behalf of the government of North Korea or the Workers’ Party of Korea, metal, graphite, coal, or software, where any revenue or goods received may benefit the government of North Korea or the Workers’ Party of Korea.  Additionally, if the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that a foreign financial institution has knowingly conducted or facilitated significant trade with North Korea, or knowingly conducted or facilitated a significant transaction on behalf of a person designated under a North Korea-related Executive order, or under Executive Order 13382 for North Korea-related activity, that institution may, among other potential restrictions, lose the ability to maintain a correspondent account in the United States.  VI.  North Korea Sanctions Resources For additional information on OFAC sanctions, please see the North Korean Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 510. For questions or concerns related to OFAC sanctions regulations and requirements, including disclosing a potential violation of U.S. sanctions regulations, please contact OFAC’s Compliance Hotline at 1-800-540-6322 or OFAC_Feedback@treasury.gov. To submit a request to OFAC for a specific license, see https://licensing.ofac.treas.gov/Apply/Introduction.aspx.  The DHS Q&A publication focuses on CAATSA Title III Section 321(b), which affects the entry of merchandise produced by North Korean nationals or citizens. CAATSA reiterates the need for comprehensive due diligence by and on behalf of U.S. companies involved in importing goods. Careful consideration of, and reasonable care with respect to, the different risks presented in your supply chain should always be taken into account when importing into the United States.  Importers have an obligation to exercise reasonable care and take all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure that goods entering the United States comply with all laws and regulations. To assist importers in understanding these obligations, CBP recently updated and published an Informed Compliance Publication, What Every Member of the Trade Community Should Know: Reasonable Care. CBP has also published seven fact sheets on various topics related to forced labor, including Forced Labor – Importer Due Diligence. These are also posted on CBP.gov.  The Responsible Sourcing Tool, funded by the State Department, is an online platform with resources to help federal contractors, acquisitions officers, and businesses identify, prevent, and address human trafficking risks in their global supply chains. The site contains information on industries and commodities at risk for trafficking or trafficking-related activities, as well as 10 risk management tools and a set of tools specific to the seafood industry.  [1] Annex 1 provides a more detailed description of the North Korean sanctions prohibitions related to supply chains.  [2] The State Department regularly reports on countries and industries hosting North Korean laborers in our annual reports including the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and Trafficking in Persons Report. In addition, a number of NGOs have conducted extensive research on this topic and have released public reports. These NGOs include the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights, the ASAN Institute, C4ADS, and the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea.  [3] Indicators in section B may apply to either North Korean laborers producing revenue for the North Korean government, or to North Korean refugees and asylum seekers, unless otherwise specified.  [4] Pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, Sec. 701 of Public Law 114-74, OFAC adjusted its civil monetary penalty amounts on August 1, 2016, February 10, 2017, and March 19, 2018, and will adjust those amounts annually.   ANNEXES AND  HYPERLINKS IN ORIGINAL PDF\n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:  1) OFAC does not clarify the relationship between CAATS Act Section 302(A) and 510.205 of the NKSR. The former creates a rebuttable presumption, rebuttable only with clear and convincing evidence, that all goods made \"in part\" with North Korean labor are produced with convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions. This provision therefore clearly applies to goods that are not of North Korean origin for customs purposes.   510.205, which operates independently from CAATS Act Section 302(A), prohibits \"[t]he importation into the United States, directly or indirectly, of any goods, services, or technology from North Korea is prohibited.\" The NKSR does not have the sort of provision that the CACR does (515.204), making explicit that no U.S. person may deal in a product that is \"[i]s made or derived in whole or in part of any article which is the growth, produce or manufacture of Cuba.\"   For the CACR, it is clear that a de minimis amount of Cuban raw material integrated into a finished product can taint the entire product. The NKSR's import ban and the EO it implements are silent on just how much North Korean material renders an item within the scope of the prohibition, but OFAC has made relatively clear that it interprets the provision strictly, close to if not as strictly as 515.204 of the CACR. See North Korea Sanctions Program - Program Overview (2016), making clear that the North Korea import ban extends well beyond items that are of North Korean origin for customs purposes.  IMPORTING FROM NORTH KOREA Pursuant to E.O. 13570, goods, services, and technology from North Korea may not be imported into the United States, directly or indirectly, without a license from OFAC or applicable exemption. This broad prohibition applies to goods, services, and technology from North Korea that are used as components of finished products of, or substantially transformed in, a third country. Importers seeking a license from OFAC must provide the information specified in 31 C.F.R. § 501, subpart E, to OFAC. Those wishing to request a license are directed to the Specific Licenses section of this brochure for details. U.S. depository institutions handling letters of credit or documentary collections involving imports from North Korea should obtain a copy of OFAC’s license from the importer before proceeding with such transactions. The license must also be provided to U.S. Customs and Border Protection before imports from North Korea will be allowed into the United States.  See also  e.l.f. Cosmetics, Inc. (2019), implying the same. The e.l.f. case highlights the need to exercise heightened due diligence when sourcing from Chinese suppliers that are likely to have relationships with North Korea. To the extent that a given Chinese company is affiliated with any of the joint ventures listed in the annex to this document, OFAC would presumably consider that fact something that would trigger especially tight diligence requirements.   Taking the foregoing into account, note however that the statement that the \"United States\" prohibits \"[t]he importation into the United States of any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, and manufactured wholly or in part by North Korean citizens or nationals\" is not an interpretation of the OFAC-administered import ban implemented by 510.205. That is a reference to The CAATS Act provision, administered by Customs. The difference is not wholly insignificant since 510.205 applies to facilitations, importations into third countries, and other activity short of actual importation into the U.S. of the goods, while the Customs-administered provision does not. Dealings abroad by U.S. persons in goods made in part with the labor of any North Korean citizen is not, inherently, within the scope of the NKSR.  2) See DHS FAQs on CAATS Act Section 321(b) at https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/03/30/CAATSA-title-iii-section-321b-faqs\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

See generally enforcement actions and guidance documents pertaining to 560.201 for guidance on the likely way in which this provision would be interpreted with respect to both imports of goods as well as services.    2) NO SUBSTANTIAL TRANSFORMATION RULE  The ITSR contains a few interpretive provisions defining the scope of the import ban that OFAC that one should presume are applicable in the NKSR context. See 560.406 (Transshipment or transit through the United States); 560.408   Importation into and release from a bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone; 560.416 (Brokering services) and 560.419 (U.S. employment of persons ordinarily resident in Iran).   One crucial difference between the NKSR and ITSR import bans is that the ITSR specifically exempts products made of Iranian materials that are substantially transformed in a third country. If there was any question as to whether the NKSR import prohibition would impliedly contain a similar limitation, it was resolved by Civil Enforcement Information - e.l.f. Cosmetics, Inc. (2019), which clarifies that goods containing North Korean materials are subject to the import ban even if the goods themselves are not, in the customs sense, of \"North Korean origin.\" See also North Korea Sanctions Program - Program Overview (2016), and comments thereto. \"[G]oods, services, and technology from North Korea may not be imported into the United States, directly or indirectly, without a license from OFAC or applicable exemption. This broad prohibition applies to goods, services, and technology from North Korea that are used as components of finished products of, or substantially transformed in, a third country.\"  In the e.l.f. case, the facts suggest that OFAC considered the importation of a Chinese-origin item made from North Korean components and/or raw materials to constitute an \"indirect\" importation of goods \"from North Korea.\"  3) [RESERVED]  4) WHAT DOES \"IMPORTATION INTO THE UNITED STATES\" MEAN? COMPARISON WITH THE SSR IN CONNECTION WITH DEALINGS ABROAD IN ITEMS \"FROM NORTH KOREA\"  i) Background  The import ban of the NKSR is structured like that of the Crimea embargo, where there are broad prohibitions on the \"importation into the United States, directly or indirectly, of any goods, services, or technology from\" the prohibited destination. There are also standard facilitation and export prohibitions.   The sum of those prohibitions, on their faces and with respect to offshore dealings involving goods that would be within the scope of 560.205 if imported into the United States, appears to be substantially narrower than the prohibitions found in the CACR (515.204) and ITSR (560.206). Those provisions, on their faces, prohibit dealings abroad in goods of Iranian or Cuban origin, even when there is no importation or exportation, and even when the transaction involves no Iranian or Cuban person. The question, on which, as of 8/2019, the regulations and OFAC are silent, is whether any dealing, or the facilitation of any dealing, in items within the scope of the broad import ban of the NKSR are also prohibited by one or more prohibitions of the NKSR. Take, for example, an auto part that has come to rest in a third country, is not of North Korean origin for customs purposes, but is discovered to be made in part from a North Korean rare earth material (accounting for, say 5% of the value of the item). Can a U.S.-person bank process dollar payments related to the sale of that item from France to Italy?  ii) The Relevance of the Now-repealed SSR  In the now-repealed Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, there was a prohibition against \"the importation into the United States, directly or indirectly, of any goods or services of Sudanese origin\" (538.204), where \"Sudanese origin\" was defined to describe \"[g]oods produced, manufactured, grown, extracted, or processed within Sudan,\" and \"[g]oods which have entered into Sudanese commerce\" (538.412). There was also a standard export prohibition (the exportation or reexportation, directly or indirectly, to Sudan of any goods, technology...or services from the United States...is prohibited - 583.205).   There was also a uniquely worded \"Prohibited facilitation\" provision covering exports to and from Sudan, specifying that \"the facilitation by a United States person...of the exportation or reexportation of goods, technology, or services from Sudan to any destination, or to Sudan from any location, is prohibited\" (538.206). Note that the facilitation prohibition did not, like that of the NKSR, simply refer back to other prohibitions in the SSR. Instead, it appeared to broaden the scope of the prohibited activity to activities that were not actually covered by the import and export prohibitions, which on their faces referred to imports into the United States and exports from the United States.  On top of that, there was an \"Offshore transactions\" interpretive provision (538.408), unique to the SSR, specifying that the prohibition on the facilitation of exports to and from Sudan, from any location, applied to all types of \"dealing in\" any item that a \"U.S. person knows, or has reason to know, [is] of Sudanese origin.\" On at least one occasion, OFAC fined a U.S. person for \"facilitating\" the export of Sudanese origin goods from one non-U.S. location to another (Civil Enforcement Information - Erfan Enterprises, Inc. - 2007).  iii) Application to the NKSR  The above discussion of the SSR serves to caution that a broad embargo program does not need to have 200-level prohibitions as broad as those seen in the CACR (515.204) and ITSR (560.206) in order to prohibit all dealings worldwide in all items of, broadly defined, sanctioned country \"origin.\" In the SSR, OFAC, through the facilitation prohibition, the definition of \"Sudanese origin\" and 538.408, turned the SSR into an ITSR/CACR-style prohibition on all dealings in goods having anything to do with the sanctioned country.   We highlight the scope of the import, export and facilitation prohibition in the SSR because, together, they seem to be the only thing that OFAC could point to as a means to argue that the public is on notice that the prohibitions of the NKSR and Crimea embargoes extend to offshore dealings in all items that would be within the scope of the import ban if they were imported into the United States. It remains very unclear how OFAC treats these questions in the NKSR and Crimea contexts. The interpretive provision of the SSR made it very clear that offshore dealings in Sudanese-origin goods, and the facilitation thereof, was prohibited, and the 200-level facilitation provision specifically referred to the facilitation of imports and exports to or from any destination, while the NKSR facilitation prohibition relates back to the prohibition on imports into the United States.   The NKSR and Crimea embargoes lack guidance suggesting that U.S. persons are expected to ensure that transactions they facilitate do not involve items that contain even de minimis amounts of North Korean origin components and/or raw materials. While OFAC did specifically state, in North Korea Sanctions Program - Program Overview (2016), that the import prohibition extended even to raw materials and components, OFAC provided no suggestion that the import, export or facilitation prohibitions contained in the NKSR and its underlying EOs extended to offshore dealings in any item that would be within the scope of 510.205 if imported into the United States. In addition, OFAC released guidance specifically aimed at the question of diligence expectations with respect to supply chains tainted by North Korean involvement, which was also silent on the relationship between the primary sanctions prohibitions of the NKSR and the facilitation of dealings involving items within the scope of 510.205. The e.l.f. Cosmetics web post is also silent on the question of dealings other than importations into the United Sates.  In sum, OFAC could, if it wanted to, issue guidance explaining that the 200-level prohibitions of the NKSR apply on a worldwide basis to all dealings in, and the facilitation of all dealings in, items that would be within the broad scope of 510.205 if they were imported into the U.S. However, given the amount of time that has elapsed since the initial imposition of the full North Korea embargo, and in light of the substantial differences in the text of the regulations that do reach that far (e.g. the ITSR, CACR and SSR regulations), there is a good reason to doubt that OFAC would seek to enforce an interpretation of the NKSR of such breadth without first providing notice to the regulated public that it interprets the NKSR as broadly as the other embargo programs, there the latter were explicit in their breadth in a way that the NKSR is not.   From a policy perspective, there is good reason to believe that OFAC does not intend for the NKSR to extend to all transactions related to all goods within the scope of 510.205, even when not imported into the U.S. Otherwise, Chinese banks (and trading companies) dealing in dollars would \"cause\" a violation of the NKSR every time they routed a transaction through the U.S. that involved a product containing small amounts of North Korean origin materials or components. An interpretation of the NKSR stretching that broadly would, at a minimum, merit clear articulation, and in any event is something OFAC could be understood to want to avoid. Compare the current structure of the ITSR, which, in spite of the extreme reach of sanctions on Iran generally and the oil industry in particular, still does not prohibit dealings in and related to petroleum products containing Iranian-origin raw materials when the materials \"have been incorporated into manufactured products or substantially transformed in a third country by a person other than a United States person.\" 560.407. Obviously, the government would like there to be no dealings in such products made from such materials, since it would reduce the demand for the materials. Putting all products made from such materials within the scope of the ITSR was evidently deemed disruptive to trade in energy products to the point where it would have been counterproductive.  Finally, one last important piece of evidence for the proposition that a prohibition on the \"importation\" of certain items into the U.S. is fundamentally different than a prohibition on the dealing in those items abroad is found in Sec. 2(c) and (d) of EO 13582 of August 17, 2011. Sec. (c) prohibits \"the importation into the United States of petroleum or petroleum products of Syrian origin,\" while Sec. (d) prohibits \"any transaction or dealing by a United States person, wherever located, including purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping, brokering, approving, financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing, in or related to petroleum or petroleum products of Syrian origin.\" Sec. 1 of EO 13570 of April 18, 2011 (implemented by 510.205), in contrast, simply states that \"the importation into the United States, directly or indirectly, of any goods, services, or technology from North Korea is prohibited.\" The near contemporaneousness of EO 13582 and EO 13570, with one simultaneously prohibiting imports and all dealings abroad in certain items, and the other only prohibiting imports into the United States, makes it fairly clear that the scope of the prohibition on dealings abroad in goods within the scope of the import ban is not something that is inherently within the scope of the import ban.  5) RELATIONSHIP WITH 510.201  Prohibitions on dealing in property in which a blocked person has an interest are inherently farther reaching than import and export prohibitions. Exercise caution when interpreting the prohibitions concerning imports of services from North Korea, because the government is blocked and North Korea has an extremely limited private sector, meaning that dealings short of \"importations\" covered by this provision may nevertheless be considered dealings in property in which the government has an \"interest.\" OFAC appears to consider a producer to lose its \"interest\" in goods once they have been sold \"free and clear\" in the context of an offshore transaction, but there is some uncertainty surrounding this issue. See General Note on the Notion of an \"Interest in Property\" as Applied to Physical Goods and Technology Produced or Processed in Whole or in Part by Blocked Persons (System Ed. Note).  6) See Case No. UKRAINE-EO13685-2018-350266-1, concerning the indirect importation of services in the context of a dealing with a non-sanctioned third-country entity that employs an individual ordinarily resident in a sanctioned country that may be involved in a given transaction with a USP. This determination may be particularly notable in the NKSR context, given the concerns with third country entities' use of North Korean laborers.\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

(a)  All transactions prohibited by § 510.206 that are related to the exportation or reexportation to North Korea of agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices, or replacement parts or components for medical devices, in each case that are not subject to the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 774) (EAR), are authorized, provided that the agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices, or replacement parts or components: (1)  Would be designated as EAR99 if they were located in the United States; (2)  Are not luxury goods as set forth in 15 CFR 746.4(b)(1), including identified as examples of luxury goods in 17 CFR part 746, supplement no. 1; (3)  Are approved for exportation or reexportation to North Korea by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolution 1718 (2006), to the extent such approval is required; (4)  Are not exported or reexported to any military, intelligence, or law enforcement purchaser or importer; and (5)  Replacement parts are limited to a one-for-one export or reexport basis (i.e., only one replacement part can be exported or reexported to replace a broken or non-operational part).  Note 1 to paragraph (a). Separate authorization from OFAC is required for export or reexport by a U.S. person to North Korea of items that are not subject to the EAR, other than agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices, or replacement parts or components for medical devices as described in this paragraph. See § 510.512 for a general license authorizing certain transactions by nongovernmental organizations, including exports and reexports of certain items that are not subject to the EAR.  (b)  For the purposes of this section, agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices are defined as follows: (1)  Agricultural commodities. The term agricultural commodities means products: (i)  That fall within the term \"agricultural commodity\" as defined in section 102 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5602); and (ii)  That are intended for ultimate use as: (A)  Food for humans (including raw, processed, and packaged foods; live animals; vitamins and minerals; food additives or supplements; and bottled drinking water) or animals (including animal feeds); (B)  Seeds for food crops; (C)  Fertilizers for the purposes of food production; or (D)  Reproductive materials (such as live animals, fertilized eggs, embryos, and semen) for the production of food animals. (2)  Medicine. The term medicine means an item that falls within the definition of the term \"drug\" in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321). (3)  Medical device. The term medical device means an item that: (i)  Falls within the definition of \"device\" in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321); and (ii)  Is not on the List of Medical Devices Requiring Specific Authorization, which is maintained on OFAC’s website (www.treasury.gov/ofac) on the North Korea Sanctions page.  Note 2 to § 510.521. Pursuant to 17 CFR 746.4(a), a license from the Department of Commerce is required to export or reexport any item subject to the EAR to North Korea, except food and medicine designated as EAR99, unless a license exception applies.        \n=== END DOCUMENT TEXT ===\n\n=== COMMENTARY ===\nNotes:   1)     BACKGROUND   This GL, implemented on 2-15-24, is a highly modified version of OFAC’s standard ag/med GL, as applied in the context of a broad territory-based embargo program. Compare Ukraine General License Number 18. Certain aspects of this GL, when compared to others, are as follows:   (i)             The GL only applies to items not subject to the EAR (510.520 is designed to broadly address items subject to the EAR; compare 542.525 of the SySR); (ii)            There is an exclusion for \"luxury goods\" (which, as highlighted in FAQ # 1163, includes tobacco); (iii)           Items must be \"designated as EAR99 if they were located in the United States\" (compare section 542.525 of the SySR, operating in a similar manner); (iv)           Items must be \"approved for exportation or reexportation to North Korea by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolution 1718 (2006), to the extent such approval is required\" (see relevant UN webpage at https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1718); (v)            There is the \"military, intelligence, or law enforcement purchaser or importer\" exclusion (compare 560.530 of the ITSR); (vi)           There is a \"one-for-one\" replacement parts GL (compare 589.513 and FAQ # 119).   2)   SCOPE OF ITEMS COVERED ` With respect to the definitions of \"agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices\" at paragraph (b), these definitions are generally standard (compare Ukraine General License Number 18), except (i) it is specified that \"fertilizers\" must be \"Fertilizers for the purposes of food production\" (this language is specific to the NKSR; Case No. IA-2016-337301-1 may be of assistance here), and (ii) there, as is the case with the Iran program, a \"List of Medical Devices Requiring Specific Authorization, which is maintained on OFAC’s website (www.treasury.gov/ofac) on the North Korea Sanctions page\" (note that the list is not yet available as of 2-15-24).   a) Agricultural Commodities   While North Korea, as a country on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, does not qualify for TSRA, the GL uses a definition of \"Agricultural commodities\" that is pulled directly from TSRA, with the addition of \"food for humans,\" where such food may or may not fall within the scope of TSRA's definition \"Agricultural commodities.\" This is consistent with OFAC's longstanding practice concerning its administration of TSRA-related GLs. See OFAC TSRA Program Description & Background (2017), in which OFAC explains the relationship between TSRA and the GLs covering \"food for humans,\" with OFAC considering \"food\" to be within the scope of TSRA to effect the purpose of the statute, and see License Application Guidelines for Exports to Iran and Sudan of Agricultural Commodities, Medicine, and Medical Devices (2011), in which OFAC clarifies that one may rely on the list prepared by the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service for determining what qualifies as an \"agricultural commodity\" for the purposes of the definition of that term in this GL (See List of \"Agricultural Commodities\" for TSRA Purposes (Commodities Eligible for Shipment to Cuba Agricultural, Fish and Forestry)). It should be assumed that the list is the benchmark for defining \"agricultural commodities\" here, subject to the various exclusions and exceptions contained in the GL.   b) Medical Devices   Subject to the proviso that there is a list of excluded medical devices for purposes of this GL, the following items are presumably within the scope of the term \"medical devices\";(i) those included on Iran - List of Medical Supplies, Iran - List of Medical Devices Requiring Specific Authorization, List of Medical Supplies Authorized under Ukraine General License Number 4 and BIS List of EAR99 Medical Devices.   c) Replacement Parts   With respect to the \"replacement parts\" portion of the GL, compare the version that was present in the ITSR from April, 2014 through December, 2016, when the \"one-for-one\" condition present here was removed  from the ITSR [1]. (See 560.530(a)(4), 2014 version, at: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2014-title31-vol3/xml/CFR-2014-title31-vol3-part560.xml). In general, guidance on what does and does not constitute a \"replacement part\" for ITSR purposes would be presumed to apply here. As noted above, the authorizations for \"replacement parts\" are not within the scope of TSRA, so there is no objective definition of what this term entails.   3)    THE SIGNIFICANCE OF \"RELATED TO\" AND STATUS OF \"BROKERING\"   Insofar as this GL is designed to allow U.S. person involvement in exports of non-EAR items from third countries, it is very similar to 542.525 of the SySR and 560.530 insofar as 560.530 allows U.S. person exportation of certain items not subject to the EAR. The SySR and ITSR GLs cover the \"exportation\" of covered items (and implicitly transactions ordinarily incident to such exportation), which OFAC appears to interpret in a broad manner, extending to certain types of transactions that would be ordinarily characterized as \"facilitation\". (Compare e.g. FAQ # 362 (Iran context) making clear that the term \"exportation\" includes arranging for an exportation to occur from a different country than the country in which the item to be exported is actually located. See also Case No. IA-2017-348861-1 (appearing to regard non-U.S. person \"involvement\" in a non-U.S. person’s export of an item to Iran from a third country as being, itself, synonymous with the \"exportation\" of the item)).   Here, what is authorized is all transactions \"related to\" the exportation of covered items to North Korea, where \"related to\" is a term indicating maximum breadth (vis-à-vis, e.g., \"ordinarily incident and necessary to\"). Here, the GL appears to cover all manner of what would be ordinary \"facilitation\" as it relates to exports to North Korea (including the sort of \"related transactions\" described at 560.530 of the ITSR, i.e. \"the making of shipping and cargo inspection arrangements, the obtaining of insurance, the arrangement of financing and payment, shipping of the goods, receipt of payment, and the entry into contracts (including executory contracts)…\"   An interesting open question is whether \"brokering\" constitutes a type of transaction \"related to\" covered exports. \"Brokering\" is generally excluded from the range of transactions \"ordinarily incident\" to an underlying authorized transaction (see General Comment on the Relationship Between Brokering Sales of Goods and the Scope of Transactions \"Ordinarily Incident\" to Transactions Authorized). But \"related to\" is a different proposition, and it is certainly plausible that brokering would be considered a transaction \"related to\" the exportation of covered goods.   4)   INVOLVEMENT OF BLOCKED PERSONS (IN PARTICULAR THE GOVERNMENT) IN THE \"ORDINARILY INCIDENT\" CONTEXT   The GL applies on its face to transactions \"prohibited by § 510.206,\" which is the general embargo on the exportation of services and goods to North Korea. Transactions authorized by the GL extend to transactions \"ordinarily incident\" to those authorized. While there is nothing in the GL authorizing transactions involving persons blocked pursuant to 510.201, would transactions involving the Government of North Korea (e.g. payments of taxes) be authorized by this GL if they are \"ordinarily incident\" (510.404) to the exportation of the goods to non-blocked persons in North Korea? Compare 542.516, and comments thereto, describing the original version of the Syria NGO GL, which specifically licensed only against the service prohibition of the SySR (542.407), but implicitly licensed against other (non-blocking) prohibitions insofar as transactions prohibited by the other prohibitions were ordinarily incident to those licensed.   The difference is that, in the case of the original 542.516, there was a provision explicitly accounting for the situation described here (\"[n]ongovernmental organizations are authorized to engage in transactions with the [blocked] Government of Syria…including, but not limited to, payment of taxes, fees, and import duties to, and purchase or receipt of permits, licenses, or public utility services from, the Government of Syria\"). Here, there is no such provision, but it is difficult to see how one can be engaged in an otherwise prohibited exportation of goods to North Korea without at least \"facilitating\" a transaction (even if a permitting/tax transaction) involving the blocked Government of North Korea. In any event, it is clear that the purpose of limiting the authorization to \"transactions prohibited by § 510.206\" is that OFAC does not want the covered items actually being exported to government or other blocked person users.   5) See https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1718/exemptions-measures/humanitarian-exemption-requests for details on \"Humanitarian Exemption Requests\" to the 1718 Sanctions Committee (DPRK), including a comprehensive list of \"Humanitarian Exemption(s) in Effect\".\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

Can U.S. persons continue to send money to family or friends in North Korea? Yes. Section 510.511 of the North Korea Sanctions Regulations authorizes U.S. depository institutions (including banks), U.S.-registered brokers or dealers in securities, and U.S.-registered money transmitters to process non-commercial, personal remittances to or from North Korea, or for or on behalf of an individual ordinarily resident in North Korea, up to a maximum of $5,000 per year. Such transactions do not require further authorization from OFAC. This general license does not authorize any transactions by, to, or through a financial institution blocked pursuant to the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 544, or the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 594, or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to any part of 31 C.F.R. chapter V other than part 510.

Note).  1) The reason why the conduct authorized by this GL prohibited to begin with is that, without a license, remittances to North Korea would be considered an export of a financial service to North Korea, in violation of 510.206. It is not the case that all North Koreans are blocked (as was the case under the old North Korea-related regulations, issued pursuant to TWEA).   2) Given the parallelism between the way that OFAC interprets the broad-based IEEPA embargoes, as well as the broad similarities between 510.511 and the corresponding Iran general license concerning remittances (560.550), see the many interpretive guidance letters concerning remittances to Iran for guidance on how OFAC would likely interpret the terms \"ordinarily resident\" and \"noncommercial, personal remittances\" in a variety of different situations.  3) Note the \"know or reason to know\" safe harbor in 510.511. That language has, in past enforcement actions, been interpreted to require a measure of affirmative due diligence into publicly available information (Stanley Drilling Equipment & Supply, Inc., 2013, interpreting 560.204). Here, however, the explicit reference to reliance on the originator of the funds suggests that a significantly more generous knowledge standard applies.  4) Compare FAQ 435, and comments thereto.

At account opening, the account holders of all nine accounts presented to TDBNA North Korean passports. However, these passports did not generate an alert during the customer screening process because TDBNA relied heavily on a vendor-supplied Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) list (“PEP list”), which did not include government employees of sanctioned countries. In addition, TDBNA employees often misidentified North Korea (referring to it as Korea or South Korea or using a country code meant for South Korea), or left the citizenship field blank in the customer profiles.

(\"TDBNA\"), a bank incorporated in Wilmington, Delaware, has agreed to remit $115,005.04 to settle its potential civil liability for two separate matters involving apparent violations of the North Korea Sanctions Regulations and the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations. In the first matter, TDBNA processed 1,479 transactions totaling $382,685.38 and maintained nine accounts on behalf of employees of the North Korean mission to the United Nations without a license from OFAC. In the second matter, TDBNA maintained two accounts for more than four years for a U.S. resident who was listed on OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (\"SDN List\"). The apparent violations in both cases resulted from multiple sanctions compliance breakdowns, including screening deficiencies and human error, and highlight the importance of maintaining and following proper escalation procedures and ensuring adequate employee training. The settlements reflect OFAC’s determination that TDBNA’s apparent violations in both matters were voluntarily self-disclosed and were non-egregious.  Matter 1: North Korea-related Apparent Violations  Description of the Apparent Violations of the North Korea Sanctions Regulations  Between December 20, 2016 and August 15, 2018, TDBNA processed 1,479 transactions totaling $382,685.38, and maintained nine accounts on behalf of five employees of the North Korean mission to the United Nations without a license from OFAC. At account opening, the account holders of all nine accounts presented to TDBNA North Korean passports. However, these passports did not generate an alert during the customer screening process because TDBNA relied heavily on a vendor-supplied Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) list (\"PEP list\"), which did not include government employees of sanctioned countries. In addition, TDBNA employees often misidentified North Korea (referring to it as Korea or South Korea or using a country code meant for South Korea), or left the citizenship field blank in the customer profiles. As a result, TDBNA’s screening system did not flag any of these accounts because the citizenship information was missing or incorrect.  Under the North Korea Sanctions Regulations (NKSR), 31 C.F.R. § 510.510(c), a general license authorizing certain transactions with the North Korean Mission to the United Nations specifies that it does not authorize U.S. financial institutions to open and operate accounts for employees of the North Korean mission. It further specifies that U.S. financial institutions are required to obtain OFAC specific licenses to operate accounts for such persons. Because TDBNA did not have a specific license to provide these services, its conduct resulted in the apparent violations of 31 C.F.R. § 510.201.  Penalty Calculation and General Factors Analysis Related to the Apparent Violations of the North Korea Sanctions Regulations  The statutory maximum civil penalty applicable for these North Korea-related apparent violations is $460,800,198. OFAC determined that TDBNA voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations and the apparent violations constitute a non-egregious case. Accordingly, under OFAC’s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines (\"Enforcement Guidelines\"), the base civil monetary penalty amount applicable in this matter equals the sum of one-half the transaction value for each apparent violation, which is $191,343 in this matter.  The settlement amount of $105,238.65 for this matter reflects OFAC’s consideration of the General Factors under the Enforcement Guidelines.  OFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:  (1)  TDBNA failed to exercise due caution or care in processing 1,479 transactions in apparent violation of the NKSR for more than a year as a result of multiple sanctions screening breakdowns; (2)  TDBNA had reason to know that it maintained accounts for North Korean nationals because at account opening, the account holders of all nine accounts presented to TDBNA North Korean passports; and (3)  TDBNA is a large and commercially sophisticated financial institution with a global presence.  OFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors:  (1)  No TDBNA managers or supervisors appear to have had actual knowledge about the subject accounts or transactions; (2)  Although 1,479 transactions totaling $382,685.38 were processed in apparent violation of the NKSR, all of the transactions would likely have been licensable under existing licensing policy; (3)  TDBNA has represented that it has terminated the conduct that led to the apparent violations and undertook the following remedial measures: •  TDBNA enhanced its controls for identifying government officials of sanctioned countries; •  TDBNA updated its operating procedures to specify that reviews of customers in or affiliated with sanctioned jurisdictions must be escalated; and •  TDBNA provided targeted training to address the appropriate adjudication criteria for determining whether potential customers may be PEPs from a sanctioned country, or present passports or other identification from sanctioned countries, and the escalation requirements in such cases. (4)  TDBNA voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations and cooperated with OFAC’s investigation by providing well-organized and user-friendly information in a prompt manner.  Matter 2: Foreign Narcotics Kingpin-related Apparent Violations  Description of the Apparent Violations of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations  Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez was added to the SDN List in September 2013. In February 2016, Lopez opened two joint accounts at a Miami-area TDBNA branch. A sanctions screening alert was generated for Lopez the day after account opening. Despite first and last name and date-of-birth matches to the SDN List entry for Lopez, the reviewer dismissed the alert because there was \"no match on full name DOB and geographical location.\" Over the next four years, four additional high-confidence sanctions screening alerts were generated, three of which were manually dismissed for similar reasons. Only the fifth and final alert, in February 2020, was determined by a reviewer to be a true hit, triggering the blocking of Lopez’s accounts four years late and disclosure to OFAC. After the accounts were blocked, however, TDBNA’s Fraud Unit, unaware of the sanctions-related reason for account closure, credited one of Lopez’s accounts, causing it to be re-opened. The mistake was identified a few days later and the account was re-closed.  The failure to correctly identify Lopez as a person on the SDN List was the result of human error and a breakdown in TDBNA’s sanctions compliance procedures. Lopez’s name appeared in TDBNA’s systems as \"Esperanza Maradiaga Lopez,\" while the OFAC SDN List entry has the name \"Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez.\" The date of birth information TDBNA had on file also matched the date of birth in the SDN listing. In addition to incorrectly dispositioning these alerts, TDBNA analysts contravened TDBNA procedures which require alerts to be escalated if a match occurs in first and last name and any additional information field.  This conduct resulted in 145 apparent violations of 31 C.F.R. § 598.202 of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations.  Penalty Calculation and General Factors Analysis Related to the Apparent Violations of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations  The statutory maximum civil monetary penalty for these Foreign Narcotics Kingpin-related apparent violations is $224,470,875. OFAC determined that TDBNA voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations and that the apparent violations constitute a non-egregious case.  Accordingly, under OFAC’s Enforcement Guidelines, the base civil monetary penalty amount applicable in this matter equals the sum of one-half the transaction value for each apparent violation, which is $17,757.  The settlement amount of $9,766.39 for this matter reflects OFAC’s consideration of the General Factors under the Enforcement Guidelines.   OFAC determined the following to be aggravating factors:  (1)  TDBNA failed to exercise due caution or care for U.S. economic sanctions requirements by incorrectly adjudicating high-confidence sanctions screening alerts four times over four years, despite full date-of-birth and first and last name matches, and in contravention of established procedures, enabling 145 apparent violations; (2)  TDBNA allowed $35,514.13 in transactions by a person on the SDN List; and (3)  TDBNA is a large and sophisticated financial institution with a global presence.  OFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors:  (1)  No TDBNA managers or supervisors appear to have had actual knowledge regarding the conduct that led to the apparent violations; (2)  All of the transactions would likely have been licensable under existing OFAC policy had the account holder or TDBNA applied for a license; (3)  TDBNA has represented that it has terminated the conduct that led to the apparent violations and undertook the following remedial measures: •  TDBNA implemented an explicit sequence for adjudicating and escalating alerts; •  TDBNA implemented more specific standards and examples for determining a name match, accounting for spelling variations or abbreviated, transposed, or middle names; •  TDBNA implemented more specific standards and examples for determining a date-of-birth match; and •  TDBNA required additional training related to the root causes of these apparent violations. (4)  TDBNA voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations and cooperated with OFAC’s investigation by providing well-organized and user-friendly information in a prompt manner.  Compliance Considerations  These two actions highlight the importance of developing and implementing appropriate sanctions screening controls, following internal escalation procedures, and providing comprehensive training to relevant employees.  For example, the North Korea-related matter emphasizes that banks and other financial institutions should consider taking steps to ensure accurate recordkeeping, including the correct identification of nationality, especially when providing financial services in connection with diplomatic accounts. Banks and other financial institutions should also consider implementing appropriate controls to flag highly relevant information in customer profiles that may indicate a sanctions nexus, such as accountholder passports issued by a sanctioned jurisdiction.   Similarly, in the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin-related matter, the bank’s compliance program flagged an account multiple times for a possible SDN List match, but an incorrect evaluation was made multiple times and the potential match was not escalated, in contravention of existing compliance policy. This action demonstrates the necessity of not merely developing appropriate procedures and policies for adjudicating and escalating sanctions screening alerts, but also ensuring that they are followed and implemented accordingly. This action also highlights the need for proper coordination of compliance efforts and actions across various departments and business units within a financial institution, such that a decision to block an account by one department cannot be overturned by another without appropriate controls.  Finally, both matters highlight the need for comprehensive and thorough staff training, especially for employees tasked with reviewing customer onboarding information and adjudicating potential sanctions matches. Such training helps ensure that internal policies and procedures are followed and that potential matches are properly escalated consistent with those policies and procedures.  OFAC Enforcement and Compliance Resources  On May 2, 2019, OFAC published A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments in order to provide organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in or with the United States or U.S. persons, or that use goods or services exported from the United States, with OFAC’s perspective on the essential components of a sanctions compliance program. The Framework also outlines how OFAC may incorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations and resolution of investigations resulting in settlements. The Framework includes an appendix that offers a brief analysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs OFAC has identified during its investigative process.  Information concerning the civil penalties process can be found in the OFAC regulations governing each sanctions program; the Reporting, Procedures, and Penalties Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 501; and the Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines, 31 C.F.R. Part 501, app. A. These references, as well as recent civil penalties and enforcement information, can be found on OFAC’s website at https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/civil-penalties- and-enforcement-information.

This may be the first enforcement action arising from dealings with an SDN that was also a U.S. resident but was (evidently) not a prisoner (compare MoneyGram Payment Systems, Inc., dealing with blocked prisoners). At any given time, there is a relatively small number of non-prisoner, natural person U.S. residents on the SDN list, but they do exist (compare License No. SDT-005; License No. SDT-009). OFAC does not mention this as a \"mitigating factor,\" but the scarcity of natural person non-prisoner SDN residents in the U.S. probably caused the sanctions screeners to doubt that that the apparent match was a true hit.   Also of note here is OFAC stating that \"[a]ll of the transactions [in the FNKSR case] would likely have been licensable under existing OFAC policy had the account holder or TDBNA applied for a license.\" The licensing policy referred to is probably the policy that allows the operation of accounts for the \"maintenance\" of blocked persons living in the U.S. Here, there were 145 violations with an average transaction value of $244, suggesting that the transactions were unlikely to have been commercial in nature.   2)  THE NKSR CASE  The NKSR case is unusual from both a factual and legal standpoint. The provision of financial services to a person \"ordinarily resident\" in North Korea is an exportation of services \"to\" North Korea (510.206). Of note here, OFAC does not charge a violation of 510.206. This may be because OFAC did not want to make determinations concerning the \"ordinarily resident\" status of the five employees at issue (all of whom presumably lived in New York or one of the nearby states, since the Permanent Mission of North Korea to the United Nations (\"PMNK\") is located in New York). We cannot say one way or the other whether OFAC could or would have, in the absence of 510.201, charged violations of 510.206 for all 1,479 transactions.  Instead, OFAC charges violations of 510.201, the basic blocking prohibition of the NKSR. It would be helpful to have the subsection of 510.201, but without any reference to the SDN list, we can presume that it is 510.201(a)(1), which blocks \"the Government of North Korea or the Workers' Party of Korea.\" 510.311 defines \"Government of North Korea\" (GONK) to include, among others, (i) \"any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality,\" and (ii) \"[a]ny person that is, or has been, acting or purporting to act, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of\" the GONK. If the accounts were connected to the PMNK itself, there is no question that they would have constituted property in which the GONK had an interest.   In this case, OFAC evidently considers the individual mission employees to constitute the \"Government of North Korea\" as persons \"acting or purporting to act, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of\" the GONK. This is notable, and perhaps unprecedented given the circumstances. See generally General Note on the Meaning and Significance of the Term \"Act on Behalf Of\", as It Appears in Various Contexts. In the context of the \"Government of [X]\" definition, OFAC has said that an individual employee of an Iranian government institution is not necessarily \"acting on behalf\" of the GOI when publishing in his or her personal capacity. In the case of employees of a diplomatic mission, OFAC appears to consider individual employees of the mission to be, on a per se basis, acting \"as an official representative or otherwise on behalf of a sanctioned government\" (compare 2016 Publishing Guidance). It is not illogical to draw a distinction between academics affiliated with government universities publishing on their own behalf and diplomats on assignment seeking banking services for personal user. Whether this distinction was or would have been apparent to TD Bank prior to the enforcement action is a question that OFAC answers with reference to 510.510(c). The provision states that, notwithstanding the PMNK-related GL at 510.510, \"U.S. financial institutions are required to obtain specific licenses to operate accounts for, or extend credit to, the mission or to the employees of the mission, their families, or persons forming part of their household.\"  By implication, OFAC does not consider the provision of services to employees of missions to the UN to constitute the \"official business\" of the UN itself (were it otherwise, 510.514 would have applied. Contrast Nov. 2014 Email from OFAC SC&E to Local Sudanese UNDP Staff in re: UNFCU Accounts).\n=== END COMMENTARY ===",

  "answer": "According to [Case No. DPRK2-2018-356417-1], a U.S. person donating books to North Korea can be allowable because books (or publications) are generally considered “informational materials” under the North Korea Sanctions Regulations. In that case, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) reviewed an application by The Asia Foundation to donate books—which were donated by U.S. publishers—and found that, as informational materials, they were exempt from the general export restrictions to North Korea. OFAC’s interpretation of informational materials explicitly includes publications such as donated books, so as long as the books fall under this category, the exportation (or donation) is not prohibited under the sanctions.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that even though exporting informational materials (like books) is exempt, one must avoid any transaction that involves coordination or partnership with North Korean Government entities beyond what is allowed by the exemption. OFAC specifically cautions that while donation activities related to informational materials do not require a license, coordination or partnership with North Korean government-controlled entities would still be prohibited without a specific license.\n\nIn summary, based on [Case No. DPRK2-2018-356417-1]:\n • Donating books—if they are considered informational materials—is generally exempt from the export restrictions under the North Korea Sanctions Regulations.\n • Care must be taken to ensure that the donation process does not involve prohibited forms of coordination or partnerships with blocked North Korean entities.\n\nNo other document in the search results contradicts this interpretation. Thus, provided that the donated books qualify as informational materials and the process avoids additional prohibited transactions, donating books to North Korea would not be prohibited under the current OFAC regulations."
